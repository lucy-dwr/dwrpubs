Magnetic fields (MFs) generated by electrified underwater cables may produce similar local distortions in the earth’s main field. Concern exists that these distortions may impact migration movements of MF-sensitive animals. The Trans Bay Cable (TBC) is a ± 200-kV, 400-megawatt, 85-km high-voltage direct current transmission line buried through San Francisco Bay (37° 56′ 8.81″ N, 122° 27′ 0.19″ W). Detections of adult green sturgeon implanted with acoustic transmitters were used from six cross-bay receiver arrays from 2006 to 2015 to investigate how inbound and outbound migration movements through lower portions of their route to/from upstream breeding grounds are related to the TBC’s energization status (off/on) and other local environmental variables. Here, we assess how these variables impacted transit success, misdirection from the migration route, transit times, and migration path locations within stretches between the Bay’s mouth and the start of the Sacramento River. Overall, there was varied evidence for any effect on migration behavior associated with cable status (off/on). A higher percentage of inbound fish successfully transited after the cable was energized, but this effect was nonsignificant in models including temperature. Outbound fish took longer to transit after cable energization. Inbound and outbound migration path locations were not significantly influenced by cable energization, but results suggest a potential subtle relationship between energization and both inbound and outbound paths. Overall, additional migration-based studies are needed to investigate the impact of anthropogenic cables on marine species.",Assesses impacts of anthropogenic magnetic fields on marine fish migration behavior within an ecosystem.,Marine Biology,2023,170,12,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-023-04302-4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00227-023-04302-4.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

It plays a crucial role in soil water dynamics and the understanding of various hydrological phenomena at the land surface, including infiltration, runoff, evaporation, and energy exchange processes. In recent years, proximal sensing methods have shown great potential for retrieving this challenging-to-measure property from spectral reflectance. However, a physically-based approach is still lacking as current methods rely on empirical data-driven algorithms. Here we propose a novel physics-based laboratory method that, for the first time, enables direct estimation of the entire SWRC from saturated to dry using soil water content/reflectance data pairs within the shortwave infrared domain. The main hypothesis underlying the new method is that soil optical properties not only vary with soil water content but also with the pore scale distribution of capillary and adsorbed soil water. For evaluation, retrieved soil water retention curves of 21 soils that vastly differ in physical and hydraulic properties were compared to direct measurements. The results suggest that the new method is a rapid and efficient alternative to established laboratory measurement methods.","Develops a novel laboratory method to retrieve the soil water retention curve, a fundamental soil property.",Journal of Hydrology,2023,626,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130284,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,8,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Morteza Sadeghi,2,SGMO

In this paper, we propose a new variant of OPTRAM that can map not only soil moisture, but also water bodies such as lakes and rivers. The proposed variant was tested using laboratory experimental data as well as Landsat-8 reflectance observations. Results showed the new OPTRAM variant has greater skill than the original variant in separating land and water pixels. In addition, the new variant showed less sensitivity to the model parameters, and hence, is less user dependent. To quantitatively examine the user-dependency of the model, we analyzed OPTRAM soil moisture based on Landsat-8 satellite images in California, where we varied the model parameters in a plausible range. The correlations of the resulting maps in terms of R2 between two largely different sets of parameters were found in the range of 0.47-0.52 for the original variant and 0.67-0.76 for the new variant. Because some OPTRAM parameters can be quite uncertain, particularly in wet regions, the reduced sensitivity promises more consistent soil moisture estimates across the range of parameter choices.","The article describes a remote sensing model for mapping soil moisture and surface water bodies, which are key components of the water cycle.",Science of Remote Sensing,2023,8,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.srs.2023.100105,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by-nc-nd,13,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Morteza Sadeghi,1,SGMO

However, another possible source of CHAB-derived aerosols is secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation via the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by CHABs. To examine potential SOA formation from CHABs, two cyanobacterial VOCs─2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and geosmin (GSM)─were oxidized via hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in a potential aerosol mass-oxidation flow reactor. At 100 ppbv, SOA mass yields were 15.1 ± 2% and 33.9 ± 1.3%, from 2-MIB and GSM, respectively. SOA mass concentrations generated from 2-MIB and GSM oxidations reached up to 102 ± 22 μg m–3 and 252 ± 52 μg m–3, respectively, when exposed to 8–16 days of equivalent •OH exposure. Offline molecular-level characterization of Teflon-filter collected SOA by reverse-phase liquid chromatography interfaced to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization (RPLC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS) revealed 7 distinct chemical compounds in both 2-MIB and GSM-derived SOA, which we propose for use as molecular tracers of CHAB-derived SOA in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

A cluster analysis identifies three main wave trains associated with non-ENSO SWUS precipitation in the experiments: a meridional ENSO-type wave train, an arching Pacific–North American-type (PNA) wave train, and a circumglobal zonal wave train. The zonal wave train cluster frequency differs between models and ENSO phase, with decreased frequency during El Niño and the coupled runs, and increased frequency during La Niña and the atmosphere-only runs. This is consistent with an El Niño–like bias of the atmospheric circulation in the coupled model, with strengthened subtropical westerlies in the central and eastern North Pacific that cause a retraction of the waveguide in the midlatitude eastern North Pacific. As such, zonal wave trains from the East Asian jet stream (EAJS) are more likely to be diverted southward in the east Pacific in the coupled large ensemble, with a consequently smaller role in driving SWUS precipitation variability.

We synthesized data from 2,547 surveys for riparian landbirds and 7,820 surveys for waterbirds to develop predictive distribution models, which then informed spatial prioritization analyses.

However, we also found that over 60% of the Priority Bird Conservation Areas are not currently protected, indicating a vulnerability to changes in land cover or land use.

Part of the problem is the existence of “hot spots” of methane flux, which have not been clearly identified and studied at multiple scales. Methane has a short lifetime compared to carbon dioxide; thus, efforts to avoid methane hot spots from constructed wetlands can promptly decelerate the rate of atmospheric warming. In this study we measured methane fluxes using flux towers in a restored oligohaline wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where we previously identified a hot spot of methane flux using footprint-weighed flux maps and chambers. Our main objectives with this study were to determine why this hot spot occurs and what are the biogeochemical and microbiological conditions that lead to these high methane fluxes. We found four main mechanisms that explain the existence of the hot spot. 1) The hot spot was associated with areas where the water level was closer to the surface 2) Methane originated mostly from older unoxidized peat in deeper layers, which had a shorter migration pathway to the atmosphere at the hot spot location due to soil disturbance during wetland construction. 3) Relatively lower methane oxidation in the hot spot in the upper soil layer (10-30 cm under the surface), deduced from isotopic profiles in porewater carbon and upper-level methanotroph abundance. 4) Higher ebullition events at the hot spot that can be related to low water levels and lower bulk density throughout the soil profile. This study thus suggests that mitigating soil disturbances during wetland construction and managing water level can reduce the occurrence and magnitude of hot spots of methane flux in constructed wetlands.",The study investigates mechanisms of methane flux in wetlands and proposes mitigation strategies to reduce emissions.,Environmental Research Letters,2025,20,,IOP Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ade45b,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Wakasagi (Hypomesus nipponensis, referred to as Japanese Pond Smelt) are native to Japan and were once separated from their non-native congener the endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) of the San Francisco Estuary (hereon “estuary”) of California. Wakasagi were introduced into California reservoirs in the 20th century as forage fish. Wakasagi have since expanded their distribution downstream to the estuary, but less is known about Wakasagi’s current distribution status, biology in the estuary, and negative influences on Delta Smelt. In this study, we took a comparative approach by synthesizing long-term field monitoring surveys, modeling environmental associations, and quantifying phenology, growth, and diets of Wakasagi and Delta Smelt to describe abundance and range, trends of co-occurrence, and shared ecological roles between smelt species. We found Wakasagi in greatest abundance in the upper watershed below source reservoirs, and in the northern regions of the estuary with the most co-occurrence with Delta Smelt; however, their range extends to western regions of the estuary, and we found evidence of an established population that annually spawns and rears in the estuary. We found these smelt species have similar ecological roles demonstrated by overlaps in habitat use (e.g., an association with higher turbidities and higher outflow), phenology, growth, and diets. Despite similarities, earlier hatching and rearing of Wakasagi during cooler months and reduced growth during warmer drought years suggest this species is unlike typical non-natives (e.g., Centrarchids), and they exhibit a similar sensitivity to environmental variability as Delta Smelt. This sensitivity may be why Wakasagi abundance remains relatively low in the estuary.","Examines the ecological impacts and interactions of an introduced fish species with a native, endangered species.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2022,20,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2022v20iss3art2,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7422g389/qt7422g389.pdf?t=rk01xm,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,3,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Brittany Davis,1,DISE

Currently, available MRD models for peat have strongly divergent characteristics, particularly with regard to the influence of confining stress. We assembled a large database of test data from literature and proposed a hyperbolic model, similar in form to widely used models for non-organic soils, for application to peat. We related the critical model parameters to stress history-modified effective stress, finding no strong dependence on organic content (OC) and peat composition (fibrous structure) over the parametric range of the database (OC >30%). The new model captures both the weak and strong dependencies of MRD behaviors with effective stress from literature, with weak dependence occurring in normally consolidated peats for σv′/pa>0.2 (where σv′ is vertical effective stress and pa is atmospheric pressure) and stronger dependence at smaller stresses. We present here a model for OC >30% conditions and its associated aleatory variability, which was established from residuals derived from test results.

Few are more impactful than droughts, which are predicted to increase in both frequency and severity with climate change. In this study, we examined over five decades of fish monitoring data from the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA, to evaluate the resistance and resilience of fish communities to disturbance from prolonged drought events. High resistance was defined by the lack of decline in species occurrence from a wet to a subsequent drought period, while high resilience was defined by the increase in species occurrence from a drought to a subsequent wet period. We found some unifying themes connecting the multiple drought events over the 50‐yr period. Pelagic fishes consistently declined during droughts (low resistance), but exhibit a considerable amount of resiliency and often rebound in the subsequent wet years. However, full recovery does not occur in all wet years following droughts, leading to permanently lower baseline numbers for some pelagic fishes over time. In contrast, littoral fishes seem to be more resistant to drought and may even increase in occurrence during dry years. Based on the consistent detrimental effects of drought on pelagic fishes within the San Francisco Estuary and the inability of these fish populations to recover in some years, we conclude that freshwater flow remains a crucial but not sufficient management tool for the conservation of estuarine biodiversity.","The article studies the ecological resistance and resilience of fish communities in an estuary to drought, which is a core topic in aquatic ecology.",Ecological Applications,2020,31,2,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2243,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/eap.2243,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,22,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Peggy W.

In our $10M tidal marsh restoration project, we installed over 17,000 high marsh plants to increase cover and diversity, using these plantings in a large‐scale experiment to test the benefits of clustering and soil amendments across a stress gradient. Clustered plantings have the potential to outperform widely spaced ones if plants alter conditions in ways that decrease stress for close neighbors. Here, we test whether intraspecific facilitation improves restoration outcomes using a suite of seven high marsh species native to central California salt marshes. We also applied a biochar treatment to test whether soil amendment boosts restoration success. We compared the performance of clustered and uniform plantings across the high marsh elevation gradient for 3 years. There was a strong effect of elevation on plant performance and clear signs of plant stress related to soil conditions. Clustering slightly improved the survival of one species out of seven, although clustering did not benefit that species in a follow‐up experiment under more stressful conditions. By contrast, clustering had strong negative effects on the growth and/or cover of all species tested. The stressors in this system—likely related to compaction and soil salinity—were not mitigated by neighbors or biochar. The prevailing negative effect on seven species from distinct evolutionary lineages lends strong generality to our findings. We therefore conclude that for this and similar high marsh systems, intraspecific facilitation confers no benefits and practitioners should space plants widely to minimize competition.

Mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ) and gadwall ( Mareca strepera ) hens typically take incubation recesses in the early morning and late afternoon, but recesses can also take place at night. We examined nocturnal incubation recess behavior for mallard and gadwall hens nesting in Suisun Marsh, California, USA, using iButton temperature dataloggers and continuous video monitoring at nests. Fourteen percent of all detected incubation recesses ( N = 13,708) were nocturnal and took place on 20% of nest‐days ( N = 8,668). Video monitoring showed that hens covered their eggs with down feathers when they initiated a nocturnal recess themselves as they would a diurnal recess, but they left the eggs uncovered in 94% of the nocturnal recesses in which predators appeared at nests. Thus, determining whether or not eggs were left uncovered during a recess can provide strong indication whether the recess was initiated by the hen (eggs covered) or a predator (eggs uncovered). Because nest temperature decreased more rapidly when eggs were left uncovered versus covered, we were able to characterize eggs during nocturnal incubation recesses as covered or uncovered using nest temperature data. Overall, we predicted that 75% of nocturnal recesses were hen‐initiated recesses (eggs covered) whereas 25% of nocturnal recesses were predator‐initiated recesses (eggs uncovered). Of the predator‐initiated nocturnal recesses, 56% were accompanied by evidence of depredation at the nest during the subsequent nest monitoring visit. Hen‐initiated nocturnal recesses began later in the night (closer to morning) and were shorter than predator‐initiated nocturnal recesses.

We marked Cinnamon Teal primarily during spring/summer in important breeding and molting regions across seven states (California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada). We assessed fall migration routes and timing, detected 186 fall stopover sites, and identified specific North American ecoregions where sites were located.

Cinnamon Teal selected a variety of flooded habitats including natural, riparian, tidal, and managed wetlands; wet agriculture (including irrigation ditches, flooded fields, and stock ponds); wastewater sites; and golf and urban ponds. Wet agriculture was the most used habitat type (29.8% of stopover locations), and over 72% of stopover locations were on private land. Relatively scarce habitats such as wastewater ponds, tidal marsh, and golf and urban ponds were highly selected in specific ecoregions. In contrast, dry non‐habitat across all ecoregions, and dry agriculture in the Cold Deserts and Mediterranean California ecoregions, was consistently avoided.

By merging stakeholder objectives with system uncertainty, and by adapting actions to changing systems and knowledge, adaptive resource management (ARM) provides a rigorous platform for making sound decisions in a changing world. Critically, however, applications of ARM could be improved by employing benchmarks (i.e., points of reference) for determining when learning is occurring through the cycle of monitoring, modeling, and decision‐making steps in ARM. Many applications of ARM use multiple model‐based hypotheses to identify and reduce systematic uncertainty over time, but generally lack benchmarks for gauging discovery of scientific evidence and learning. This creates the danger of thinking that directional changes in model weights or rankings are indicative of evidence for hypotheses, when possibly all competing models are inadequate. There is thus a somewhat obvious, but yet to be filled niche for including benchmarks for learning in ARM. We contend that carefully designed “ecological null models,” which are structured to produce an expected ecological pattern in the absence of a hypothesized mechanism, can serve as suitable benchmarks. Using a classic case study of mallard harvest management that is often used to demonstrate the successes of ARM for learning about ecological mechanisms, we show that simple ecological null models, such as population persistence ( N t +1 = N t ), provide more robust near‐term forecasts of population abundance than the currently used mechanistic models. More broadly, ecological null models can be used as benchmarks for learning in ARM that trigger the need for discarding model parameterizations and developing new ones when prevailing models underperform the ecological null model. Identifying mechanistic models that surpass these benchmarks will improve learning through ARM and help decision‐makers keep pace with a rapidly changing world.",The article focuses on improving adaptive resource management for making sound decisions using models and benchmarks.,Ecology and Evolution,2022,12,1,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8541,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ece3.8541,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Understanding how habitat features influence predator movements may facilitate management of upland and wetland breeding habitats that reduces predator encounter rates with duck nests and increases nest survival rates. For 1618 duck nests, nest survival increased with distance to phragmites ( Phragmites australis ), shrubs, telephone poles, human structures, and canals, but not for four other habitat features. Using GPS collars, we tracked 25 raccoons ( Procyon lotor ) and 16 striped skunks ( Mephitis mephitis ) over 4 years during waterfowl breeding and found marked differences in how these predators were located relative to specific habitat features; moreover, the probability of duck nests being encountered by predators differed by species. Specifically, proximity to canals, wetlands, trees, levees/roads, human structures, shrubs, and telephone poles increased the likelihood of a nest being encountered by collared raccoons. For collared skunks, nests were more likely to be encountered if they were closer to canals, trees, and shrubs, and farther from wetlands and human structures. Most predator encounters with duck nests were attributable to a few individuals; 29.2% of raccoons and 38.5% of skunks were responsible for 95.6% of total nest encounters. During the central span of duck nesting (April 17–June 14: 58 nights), these seven raccoons and five skunks encountered &gt;1 nest on 50.8 ± 29.2% (mean ± SD) and 41.5 ± 28.3% of nights, respectively, and of those nights individual raccoons and skunks averaged 2.60 ± 1.28 and 2.50 ± 1.09 nest encounters/night, respectively. For collared predators that encountered &gt;1 nest, a higher proportion of nests encountered by skunks had evidence of predation (51.9 ± 26.6%) compared to nests encountered by raccoons (22.3 ± 17.1%).

In wetland ecosystems, human impacts are centered around hydrologic manipulation including the common practice of wetland diking and impoundment. Constraining how wetland management influences plant biodiversity patterns across spatial scales will provide information on how best to modify actions to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem function in managed wetlands. Here, we compare patterns of plant diversity and species presence, abundance, and community composition at several spatial scales among tidal wetlands along an estuarine salinity gradient and managed wetlands that were formerly tidal. Managed impounded wetlands had decreased alpha and gamma diversity of rare species, with less than 60% of the species richness found in tidal brackish wetlands at several spatial scales. There was little change in the overall pattern of alpha, beta, and gamma diversity for common species in impounded wetlands; however, dominant tidal brackish species, primarily perennial rhizomatous graminoids, were replaced with management target plants and non‐native annual grasses in impounded wetlands. This species replacement led to over 60% of impounded sites being classified as containing novel plant assemblages. An additional 25% of impounded sites were classified as containing tidal saline plant assemblages, suggesting potential soil salinization. Along the estuarine gradient, patchiness and codominance of common plant species drove high diversity and turnover in tidal brackish wetlands, while it remains unclear whether tidal fresh or brackish wetlands maximize rare plant diversity.

The Mendocino Complex (2018), one of the largest wildfires in California's post‐settlement history, burned 40% of the Clear Lake watershed, providing a timely opportunity to study the impacts of historical and current wildfires on this valuable aquatic resource. Using long‐term monthly monitoring data from 1968 to 2019, paired with historical watershed fire data, we found that for the three largest fire years in the watershed's history, 3‐year postfire median July–October epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below or equal to 3‐year prefire TP concentrations. However, both median TP epilimnetic concentrations and deepwater temperature across the lake have increased since the late 1960s. Long‐term TP increases were more strongly correlated with monthly maximum air temperatures than precipitation, suggesting a potential role of warming‐induced water column stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, and high potential for internal phosphorus loading. Hypoxic occurrences were correlated with higher hypolimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus and TP concentrations, but additional high‐frequency monitoring of DO will help determine the duration of anoxia and its contribution to internal phosphorus loading. These long‐term data suggest that for this large, hypereutrophic lake, wildfires did not significantly alter in‐lake TP concentrations based on long‐term, monthly monitoring and that other internal or external sources of TP may mask any wildfire effects. Nonetheless, our study underscores the value of synthesizing decades of water quality, watershed wildfire, and climate data to build a more comprehensive, nuanced picture of multiple long‐term threats to aquatic ecosystems under global change.

Although infection with low pathogenic AIVs is generally considered asymptomatic in wild birds, prior work has shown that influenza‐infected birds occasionally delay migration and/or reduce local movements relative to their uninfected counterparts. However, most observational research to date has focused on a few species in northern Europe; given that influenza viruses are widespread globally and outbreaks of highly pathogenic strains are increasingly common, it is important to explore influenza–movement relationships across more species and regions. Here, we used telemetry data to investigate relationships between influenza infection and movement behavior in 165 individuals from four species of North American waterfowl that overwinter in California, USA. We studied both large‐scale migratory and local overwintering movements and found that relationships between influenza infection and movement patterns varied among species. Northern pintails ( Anas acuta ) with antibodies to avian influenza, indicating prior infection, made migratory stopovers that averaged 12 days longer than those with no influenza antibodies. In contrast, greater white‐fronted geese ( Anser albifrons ) with antibodies to avian influenza made migratory stopovers that averaged 15 days shorter than those with no antibodies. Canvasbacks ( Aythya valisineria ) that were actively infected with influenza upon capture in the winter delayed spring migration by an average of 28 days relative to birds that were uninfected at the time of capture. At the local scale, northern pintails and canvasbacks that were actively infected with influenza used areas that were 7.6 and 4.9 times smaller than those of uninfected ducks, respectively, during the period of presumed active influenza infection. We found no evidence for an influence of active influenza infection on local movements of mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ). These results suggest that avian influenza can influence waterfowl movements and illustrate that the relationships between avian influenza infection and wild bird movements are context‐ and species‐dependent. More generally, understanding and predicting the spread of multihost pathogens requires studying multiple taxa across space and time.",Studies waterfowl movement and behavior in relation to avian influenza infection.,Ecosphere,2023,14,2,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4432,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.4432,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

However, knowledge gaps exist around the abiotic and biotic drivers behind its variable population dynamics—as well as on the ability of the species to show spatially structured trends that stabilize population portfolios in the face of environmental change. Here we examined how historical hydroclimatic variability in the San Francisco Estuary (California) has driven age‐0 Pacific herring population dynamics over 35 years. First, we used wavelet analyses to examine spatiotemporal variation and synchrony in the environment, focusing on two key variables: salinity and temperature. Next, we fitted multivariate autoregressive state‐space models to environmental and abundance time series to test for spatial structure and to parse out abiotic (salinity and temperature) from biotic influences (spawning and density dependence). Finally, we examined the stabilizing effects of spatially asynchronous population fluctuations (i.e., portfolio effects) across the estuary. Our results showed that temperature, but not salinity, fluctuated synchronously across regions on seasonal and decadal timescales. The top‐ranked model showed strong evidence of regional population structure and regional variation in population responses to the environment. As expected, age‐0 herring were generally associated with cooler, saltier conditions in spring. Density dependence was strong in all regions, suggesting that local factors influencing rearing conditions limited juvenile population growth across the estuary. Additionally, age‐0 abundance fluctuations were on average 15% more stable across the estuary than in individual regions, demonstrating that portfolio effects arising from population asynchrony have helped to stabilize recruitment across the estuary over the past four decades. We contend that ecosystem‐based fishery management strategies to restore eelgrass and tidal marsh rearing habitats could increase the carrying capacity of the estuary, further stabilizing the herring population and reducing the risk of fishery closures.",Studies fish population dynamics in an estuary to inform fishery management strategies.,Ecosphere,2023,14,5,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4440,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.4440,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Although previous experimental studies have examined the consequences of phenological timing in plant-herbivore interactions for both plants and their herbivores, less is known about their effects on subsequent plant reproduction. Here, we conducted an experiment to determine how shifts in the phenological timing of monarch (Danaus plexippus) larval herbivory affected milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis) host plant performance, including effects on growth and subsequent effects on flower and seed pod phenology and production. We found that variation in the timing of herbivory affected both plant growth and reproduction, with measurable effects several weeks to several months after herbivory ended. The timing of herbivory had qualitatively different effects on vegetative and reproductive biomass: early-season herbivory had the strongest effects on plant size, whereas late-season herbivory had the strongest effects on the production of viable seeds.

Using structural equation models (SEMs) and four decades of integrated data from the San Francisco Estuary, we investigated the relative effects of top‐down, bottom‐up, and environmental drivers on multiple trophic levels of the pelagic food web along an estuarine salinity gradient and at both annual and monthly temporal resolutions. We found that interactions varied across the estuarine gradient and that the detectability of different interactions depended on timescale. For example, for zooplankton and estuarine fishes, bottom‐up effects appeared to be stronger in the freshwater upstream regions, while top‐down effects were stronger in the brackish downstream regions. Some relationships (e.g., bottom‐up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton) were seen primarily at annual timescales, whereas others (e.g., temperature effects) were only observed at monthly timescales. We also found that the net effect of environmental drivers was similar to or greater than bottom‐up and top‐down effects for all food web components. These findings can help identify which trophic levels or environmental factors could be targeted by management actions to have the greatest impact on estuarine forage fishes and the spatial and temporal scale at which responses might be observed.

To investigate prey diversity important to the planktivorous larval longfin smelt ( Spirinchus thaleichthys ) and Pacific herring ( Clupea pallasii ) from the San Francisco Estuary, we used DNA metabarcoding analysis of the cytochrome oxidase I gene on the guts of these fishes and on environmental zooplankton samples, in comparison with results from abundance analyses of zooplankton samples. Overall, both fish consumed the prey that were commonly available and relatively abundant: Diets were dominated by arthropods but also included soft‐bodied and difficult to identify organisms. Prey taxa substantially overlapped between the two species (Schoener's index = 0.66), and alpha diversity analysis suggested high variability in the content of guts from different individuals. Abundant prey taxa in both fish species included the copepods Eurytemora carolleeae , Acanthocyclops americanus , and A . robustus ; Acanthocyclops spp. are difficult to distinguish morphologically. Differential abundance analysis suggested that both species consumed the most abundant zooplankton in lower proportions than their availability in the environment. A few uncommon prey observed in the diets may hint at feeding strategies employed by the larvae, such as herring DNA in the longfin smelt diets, suggesting feeding on eggs near substrates or schooling behavior. Herring consumed the small (&lt;0.5 mm) copepod Limnoithona tetraspina much more frequently (30%) than did smelt (2%), possibly indicating differences in foraging behavior or sensory abilities. Among the unexpected prey found in the diets was the cnidarian Hydra oligactis , the polychaete Dasybranchus sp., and the copepod Mesocyclops pehpeiensis , a species not previously described in the San Francisco Estuary.

Modelling riparian forest characteristics based on the age and evolution of floodplains is useful in predicting ecosystem functions that depend on the size and density of trees, including large wood delivered to river channels, forest biomass and habitat quality. We developed a dynamic model of riparian forest structure that predicts changes in tree size and density using floodplain age derived from air photos and historical maps. Using field data and a riparian forest chronosequence for the 160‐km middle reach of the Sacramento River (California, USA), we fit Weibull diameter distributions with time‐varying parameters to the empirical data. Species were stratified into early and late successional groups, each with time‐varying functions of tree density and diameter distributions. From these, we modelled how the number and size of trees in a stand changed throughout forest succession, and evaluated the goodness‐of‐fit of model predictions. Model outputs for the early successional group, composed primarily of cottonwoods and willows, accounted for most of the stand basal area and large trees &gt;10 cm DBH for the first 50 years. Post‐pioneer species with slower growth had initially low densities that increased slowly from the time of floodplain creation. Within the first 100 years, early successional trees contributed the most large wood that could influence fluvial processes, carbon storage, and instream habitat. We applied the model to evaluate the potential large wood inputs to the middle Sacramento River under a range of historical bank migration rates. Going forward, this modelling approach can be used to predict how riparian forest structure and other ecosystem benefits such as carbon sequestration and habitat quality respond to different river management and restoration actions.","The article develops a model to predict riparian forest structure changes, explicitly for informing river management and restoration actions.",Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,2021,46,15,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5229,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,7,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

We studied egg mercury concentration, mercury burden (total amount of mercury in the egg), and egg morphometrics by egg position in the laying sequence for two songbirds: tree swallows ( Tachycineta bicolor ) and house wrens ( Troglodytes aedon ). Egg mercury concentration in the second egg laid was 14% lower for tree swallows and 6% lower for house wrens in comparison with the first egg laid. These results indicate that in both species, after an initial relatively high transfer of mercury into the first egg laid, a smaller amount of mercury was transferred to the second egg laid. This lower mercury concentration persisted among all subsequently laid eggs (eggs three to eight) in tree swallows (all were 14%–16% lower than egg 1), but mercury concentrations in subsequently laid house wren eggs (eggs three to seven) returned to levels observed in the first egg laid (all were 1% lower to 3% greater than egg 1). Egg size increased with position in the laying sequence in both species; the predicted volume of egg 7 was 5% and 6% greater than that of egg 1 in tree swallows and house wrens, respectively. This change was caused by a significant increase in egg width, but not egg length, with position in the laying sequence. The percentage of decline in mercury concentration with position in the laying sequence was considerably lower in tree swallows and house wrens compared with other bird taxonomic groups, suggesting that there are key differences in the maternal transfer of mercury into songbird eggs compared with other birds. Finally, we performed simulations to evaluate how within‐clutch variation in egg mercury concentrations affected estimates of mean mercury concentrations in each clutch and the overall sampled population, which has direct implications for sampling designs.

A two-day workshop was held on March 26–27 as part of the Salmonid Restoration Federation Conference in Santa Rosa, California and was attended by more than 80 people. A one-day workshop was held on May 4 as part of the Joint International Ecohydraulics and Fish Passage Conference in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada and attended by approximately 40 people. The goal of the workshops was to share knowledge of nature-like fishway design and long-term stability observations among practitioners, regulators, and operators to improve the collective awareness of contemporary NLF science and design methodologies to ultimately provide more effective and sustainable passage for fish. The workshops featured instruction from experts, including Tyler Kreider (organizer, Kleinschmidt), Mike Love (Michael Love and Associates), Jesus Morales (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), Bjorn Lake and Brian Cluer (National Marine Fisheries Service), Mike Garello (HDR), Barry Chilibeck (Northwest Hydraulic Consultants), and Marcin Whitman (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, retired). The following is a summary of the key topics and material covered in these workshops. The opening session introduced the concept of NLFs for restoring aquatic organism passage. It provided an overview of NLF historical development, refined design methods, and established guidelines, such as the 2016 Interagency NLF Guidelines and 2023 National Marine Fisheries Service Pre-Design Guidelines. Participants learned about different NLF concepts and their applications. This session explored site characteristics conducive to NLF installation. It covered decision making for different NLF styles (step pool, roughened channel, hybrid) and when to choose a bypass versus an inline full- or partial-width NLF. Participants gained an understanding of how to select a site and design style, and the importance of team composition in designing a NLF. Focusing on predesign aspects, this session included site characterization, stream profile evaluation, and channel stability assessment. It addressed fishway entrance and exit layout, potential risk factors, and mitigation strategies. Findings from this phase were used to establish specific design objectives for the NLF project. Attendees were invited to an informal NLF site visit at Yellowjacket Creek near the conference. This session covered factors in the NLF design process, such as riprap sizing, infrastructure accommodation, and hydraulic modeling. It discussed regulatory and public safety considerations, long-term maintenance, and fish passage effectiveness monitoring methods and results. The session concluded with a question and answer session on the discussed topics and attendee experiences. This session reviewed project implementation and construction process challenges, focusing on risk management. Topics included project delivery methods, contractor selection, material procurement, quality control, construction methods, stream diversions, instream work permitting, and surveying methods. Emphasis was placed on meeting design intent, managing risks, and achieving long-term performance objectives.

Biomass reductions may also alter evaporation. These changes are generated when water that previously would have been transpired or evaporated from the canopy of the removed vegetation is transferred to transpiration of the remaining vegetation, streamflow, and/or non‐canopy evaporation. In this study, we combined a new vegetation‐change water‐balance approach with lumped hydrologic modelling outputs to examine the effects of forest biomass reductions on transpiration of the remaining vegetation and streamflow in California's Sierra Nevada. We found that on average, 102 mm and 263 mm (8.0% and 20.6% of mean annual precipitation [MAP]) of water were made available following 20% and 50% forest biomass‐reduction scenarios, respectively. This water was then partitioned to both streamflow and transpiration of the remaining forest, but to varying degrees depending on post‐biomass‐reduction precipitation levels and forest biomass‐reduction intensity. During dry periods, most of the water (approximately 200 mm [15.7% on MAP] for the 50% biomass‐reduction scenario) was partitioned to transpiration of the remaining trees, while less than 50 mm (3.9% on MAP) was partitioned to streamflow. This increase in transpiration during dry periods would likely help trees maintain forest productivity and resistance to drought. During wet periods, the hydrologic benefits of forest biomass reductions shifted to streamflow (200 mm [15.7% on MAP]) and away from transpiration (less than 150 mm [11.8% on MAP]) as the remaining trees became less water stressed. We also found that streamflow benefits per unit of forest biomass reduction increased with biomass‐reduction intensity, whereas transpiration benefits decreased. By accounting for changes in vegetation, the vegetation‐change water balance developed in this study provided an improved assessment of watershed‐scale forest health benefits associated with forest biomass reductions.","The article assesses the effects of forest biomass reductions, a land management practice, on streamflow and forest health within a watershed.",Hydrological Processes,2021,35,3,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14114,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Both high and low elevation study areas were instrumented for continuous measurements of meteorology, streamflow, and turbidity. Atmospheric and stream chemistry, suspended sediment concentration, and bedload sediment delivery were measured on a regular schedule. Soil chemical and physical properties and vegetation were systematically sampled before and after the initial thinning and prescribed burning treatments, which were implemented between 2012 and 2016. Post‐treatment data collection continues today as we explore opportunities for the second round of possible treatments. The critical research infrastructure and long‐term baseline data collection has been instrumental in building partnerships with downstream managers, end users, non‐governmental organizations, academic researchers, and national research programmes. Contributions to date include fundamental understanding of magnitude and variability of nutrient deposition; carbon, nutrient, and major ion dynamics in headwater streams; aquatic algae and macroinvertebrate populations; vegetation composition and structure; and streamflow responses to precipitation in the two elevation strata.

Often, process‐based methods are employed to predict and assess the amount of sediment in water, but there are still challenges because the mechanisms that govern sediment transport are not yet fully understood. Furthermore, complex domains make model calibration difficult. Thus, as a complementary tool, a machine‐learning model was developed in the present study to emulate an existing process‐based model in simulating suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It employs the long short‐term memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for supervised learning of a sequence of data (e.g., time series). The model was applied to the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) of California, USA, which is characterized by an interconnected system of sloughs, waterways, and a tidal outlet. The model training was performed with historical records of flow, stage and SSC at various locations within the Delta. The study period was 2010 through 2016, but the training period (i.e., range of observed data used to train the model) was varied to assess the model's sensitivity to the inputs and to determine the optimum model setup. Comparison between the model‐estimated SSC and the observation at 12 key locations within the Delta showed that the estimation accuracy of the LSTM model during the study period is comparable or superior to that of the Delta Simulation Model II‐General Transport Model (DSM2‐GTM), a process‐based operational hydrodynamics and water quality model for the Delta. In terms of the ratio of the root‐mean‐square error to the standard deviation (RSR), LSTM models generally showed higher predictability than DSM2‐GTM in all test cases investigated, with the lowest (most desirable) and highest (least desirable) LSTM‐based RSR being 0.21 and 1.14, respectively. In comparison, the lowest and highest RSR values with DSM2‐GTM were 0.26 and 3.70, respectively. The median LSTM‐based RSR of all study locations is around 0.7 while its DSM2‐GTM counterpart is about 1.0. LSTM models also yielded remarkably higher (more desirable) Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency values. Moreover, visual inspection found that LSTM models better captured the timing and magnitude of peaks as well as the temporal variations in the SSC time series. The LSTM model's performance was further analysed with hydro‐meteorological data (precipitation and wind speed) incorporated in training. While precipitation led to some improvement, the wind speed was found to have a negligible effect overall. All in all, the study findings suggest that the LSTM model has the potential to supplement the operational process‐based model in guiding water resources planning and management practices.","The article uses long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a machine learning technique, to estimate suspended sediment concentration.",Hydrological Processes,2022,36,10,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14694,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,7,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,

This study quantified responses from the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modelling system (WRF‐Hydro) to a suite of fire‐related perturbations to hydrologic soil and runoff parameters, vegetation area, land cover classifications and associated vegetation properties, and snow albedo across the heavily burned Feather River Basin in California. These experiments were used to quantify the impacts of fire‐related perturbations in model simulations under the observed meteorological conditions during the 2000–2022 water years and determine whether applying these fire‐related perturbations enhanced post‐fire model accuracy across the 11–12 post‐fire months evaluated herein. The most comprehensive fire‐aware simulation consistently modelled enhanced annual catchment streamflow (by 8%–37%), subsurface flow (by 72%–116%), and soil moisture (by 4%–9%), relative to the baseline simulation which neglected fire impacts. Simulated fire‐enhanced streamflow was predominately attributable to fire‐induced vegetation area reductions that reduced transpiration. Simulated streamflow enhancements occurred throughout the water year, excluding early‐summer (e.g., May–June) when the baseline simulation modelled relatively more snowmelt and streamflow because fire perturbations caused earlier model snow depletion. Vegetation area reductions favoured increased model ground snow accumulation and enhanced snow ablation while imposed snow albedo darkening enhanced ablation, ultimately resulting in similar peak SWE and earlier snow disappearance (on average by 8‐days) from the most comprehensive fire‐aware simulation relative to the baseline simulation. The baseline simulation had large degradations in streamflow accuracy following major fire events that were likely partially attributable to neglecting fire disturbances. Applying fire‐related perturbations reduced post‐fire streamflow anomaly biases across the three study catchments. However, remaining large post‐fire streamflow uncertainties in the fire‐perturbed simulation underscores the importance of additional observationally constrained fire‐disturbance model developments.","The article quantifies the hydrological impacts of fire on water budget, streamflow, and snow dynamics using a modeling system.",Hydrological Processes,2024,38,11,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15314,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

They tend to occur in low gradient, broad valleys where water slows and sediment accumulates, making them efficient locations for restoration. Over a century and a half of land use has degraded many meadows in the Sierra Nevada, reducing their hydrological and ecological functionality. Process‐based restoration (PBR) is an ecosystem rehabilitation approach that utilises biogeomorphic processes to facilitate functional ecosystem recovery. Low‐tech applications of PBR leverage fluvial processes, plant growth and the manipulation of onsite materials to increase structural and hydrological complexity. In meadows, typical goals associated with restoration are to increase groundwater elevations, expand wetted area, encourage sediment capture and create diffuse flow paths leading to improved ecological function over time. This study compares surface and groundwater conditions in a degraded riparian meadow in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA for 1 year before and after process‐based restoration to understand initial changes in meadow hydrogeomorphic function. Restoration included the installation of 39 postless beaver dam analog structures in ~1 km of incised meadow channel. Stage‐discharge data at the inlet and outlet of the project area were paired with groundwater data collected from 13 wells distributed across the meadow to estimate increased water storage of 3700 m 3 due to restoration. After the wet winter of 2023, we estimated that pools upstream of structures filled to over half their volume with fine sediment. We also applied hydrodynamic modelling to evaluate fluvial changes at high flows and found that restoration increased flow complexity and wetted surface area.

By identifying, tracking, and cataloguing snowstorms, we illustrate how the frequency, snow water equivalent, and other features of these events may change. Results suggest changes in snowstorm characteristics are most significant for the pessimistic pathway, especially toward the late 21st century. There is similar event frequency between the historical period and mid‐21st‐century projections but declines of 3% to 10% are still projected for snowstorm counts, hours, cumulative area, and snow water equivalent. By the late 21st century, snowstorm attributes have losses of 6% to 37% versus the historical period, revealing a projected acceleration in loss from the mid to late century. Spatially, snowstorm reduction is most dramatic along and south of the Ohio River Valley as the latitude that separates steady snowstorm counts to the north and reduced snowstorms to the south migrates poleward in the future. Similarly, extreme snowstorms decline to the south, with some northern regions experiencing increase in counts and snow water equivalent, affirming prior research theorising that some snowfall may intensify as increasing moisture in a warming climate interacts with environments with temperatures still supportive of snowfall. Significant reductions in early and late cool‐season snowstorms are projected across all future epochs, revealing a shrinking season.

We tracked postbreeding movements of gadwall ( Mareca strepera ) and mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ) females that bred in the Suisun Marsh (Suisun) of California, USA, to determine molt site selection and wing molt chronology. We attached backpack transmitters with global positioning system and global system for mobile communications (GPS‐GSM) technology to female gadwalls and mallards within Suisun and tracked the birds following the breeding season during 2015–2018. We determined molt locations for 52 female gadwalls and 112 female mallards.

The objective includes understanding the critical factors influencing the breeding and maturation of this species in captivity, contributing to conservation efforts and potential revival of this threatened species. Methods Longfin Smelt broodstock were collected from the San Francisco Estuary and reared in controlled conditions at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Laboratory (FCCL). The study involved spawning of wild broodstock, rearing of first generation (F1) progeny to adulthood, and subsequent spawning to produce F2 offspring. Key variables such as salinity, temperature, and diet were carefully managed throughout the process. Fertilization and hatching rates were calculated, and the larvae were reared using the same methods to closely monitor and understand their growth and development. Result First generation Longfin Smelt successfully matured and spawned at age 1, earlier than commonly observed in the wild. From five crosses, four produced viable offspring. The study recorded a range of fertilization rates (10–40%) and high hatching rates (75–97%). Salinity was identified as a critical factor in both larval development and adult maturation. While initial larval survival was challenging, the larval rearing system used in this study proved effective. Conclusion The study represents a major breakthrough in the cultivation of Longfin Smelt, showing that it is possible to complete their life cycle under controlled conditions.

The action included a release of approximately 46 million m 3 of additional flow in conjunction with the operation of a novel water management facility, the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates. This experimental action resulted in more low‐salinity habitat in Suisun Marsh than would have been present as compared to similar historical low‐flow summer conditions. We evaluated the effect of decreasing salinity on the species assemblage in Suisun Marsh using a combination of ordination analyses and circular statistics. We focused this analysis on long‐term monitoring data collected within Suisun Marsh during July and August and found that the aquatic community changed significantly in small sloughs but not large‐slough habitat in response to the Suisun Marsh action. The assemblage shift from July to August 2018 differed from historical trends in both slough sizes, albeit not significantly in large‐slough habitat.

Several fishes of the San Francisco Estuary have experienced significant declines in recent decades due to multiple factors, including habitat alteration and predation. The role of predation as a direct cause of mortality remains an open question, as does whether habitat conditions play a role in promoting predation on species of concern. Recent studies using visual identification of prey have found little to no evidence of predation on species listed under the Endangered Species Act such as Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha . To increase the likelihood of detecting predation, this study employed a genetic approach. We combined this technique with habitat and water quality data to investigate the role that habitat may be playing on incidence of predation. This study focused on detection of predation on Chinook Salmon and Delta Smelt, six other native fish species, and six nonnative fish species by Striped Bass Morone saxatilis and other piscivores. Unlike previous studies in the region, the proportion of predators with no prey detected in their gut contents was high (47–81%). The study detected Delta Smelt in 1.3% of Striped Bass—considerably higher than other contemporary predation studies in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. In April 2014, 6.6% of Striped Bass were positive for Chinook Salmon—substantially higher than observed in recent visual diet studies. Interestingly, native species comprised a relatively high proportion of Striped Bass prey (60%). Water temperature and conductivity were identified as significant predictors of Chinook Salmon presence in Striped Bass gut contents. This research also suggests that predation on soft‐bodied prey may be an overlooked segment of the diets of piscivores.","The study investigates predation dynamics impacting specific fish populations, directly relating to their conservation and management.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2021,41,4,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10582,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/nafm.10582,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Brian M.

Lampreys display extensive diversity in morphology and life history strategy. The extent of this diversity and the underlying genetic patterns have not yet been fully characterized. Uncertainty about species boundaries and operational taxonomic units hinders lamprey management and conservation. Limited data have been collected on California lampreys ( Lampetra spp. and Entosphenus spp.), but evidence suggests widespread population decline across the west coast of North America. Study objectives were to identify which nominal species are present at study sites across northern and central California, determine whether current taxonomic classifications accurately and sufficiently describe lamprey diversity in California, and characterize the biogeographic distribution of genetically distinct lamprey lineages across the study area. Methods To achieve these objectives, this study utilized DNA barcoding, phylogenetic analysis, and species delimitation analysis. Lamprey individuals ( N = 87) from 19 sites in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River basin, San Francisco Bay, and Klamath River basin were sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome b ( cyt b ) gene, and the data were combined with publicly available lamprey cyt b sequences for analysis. Result Results showed relatively deep phylogenetic divergence between Lampetra and Entosphenus . Distinct and genetically divergent lineages were observed within Lampetra , while distinct but genetically similar lineages were observed within Entosphenus . This study revealed novel Lampetra lineages in the Napa River and Alameda Creek, and results suggest that the biogeographic distribution of lamprey diversity may follow patterns observed in other native fishes. Species delimitation results indicated that at least seven separate candidate species of Lampetra can be found in California, suggesting that California holds more species‐level diversity than the expected three nominal Lampetra species known to occur in the state. Conclusion These results highlight the underestimated diversity of lampreys in California and the need for further assessment of taxonomic classifications and operational taxonomic unit designations of California lampreys.",Focuses on identifying lamprey species diversity to inform conservation and management of aquatic populations.,North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2023,43,6,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10959,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,4,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The main aim of AR Recon is to provide better Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts of atmospheric structures, and especially extratropical cyclones and the landfall of atmospheric rivers and their impacts along the western United States. This supports the needs of water supply resilience and flood hazard mitigation in the region. Improved NWP forecasts are achieved by collecting observations across the data‐sparse North Pacific in real time, and one major observing platform used is drifting buoys with barometers. Sea‐level pressure is a key variable in the extratropics, and since 2019, AR Recon has enabled the barometer upgrade and deployment of 309 Global Drifter Program (GDP) buoys across the North Pacific. This article provides an overview of these buoy deployments and evaluates their impact on the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). First, AR Recon has contributed to increasing sea‐level pressure data coverage across the North Pacific; and on average, between 1 January 2019 and 31 July 2024, these buoys accounted for 33.8% of those reporting sea‐level pressure. Second, using the Forecast Sensitivity Observation Impact analysis, results show that the buoys have a positive impact and therefore reduce forecast error in the IFS, particularly in the extratropical storm track of the North Pacific; similar results occur for other GDP buoys across the North Pacific and North Atlantic. A case study also shows that a buoy's sea‐level pressure observations can be particularly beneficial in anchoring the model during extreme events. This evaluation highlights the importance of buoys' sea‐level pressure observations to the IFS, and future deployments are planned during AR Recon with lessons from prior deployments incorporated, in order to get the most value out of the observations.",Focuses on atmospheric observations and numerical weather prediction for atmospheric rivers.,Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society,2025,,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.5049,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Their associated precipitation can be beneficial, by replenishing water resources, and can be detrimental, by triggering flooding and landslides. Therefore, accurate forecasts of ARs are crucial for water management and hazard preparedness. To help bring about improvements in downstream precipitation forecasts in the western United States, the AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) field campaign has been set up, which deploys research aircraft to sample essential upstream atmospheric structures using dropsondes and airborne instruments. This study examines the impacts of AR Recon dropsonde data on precipitation forecasts over the western United States in the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), for the AR Recon field seasons of 2022/23 and 2023/24. Observing‐system experiments demonstrate that dropsonde observations bring moderate, yet statistically significant improvements at various lead times. Over California, the additional observations enhance precipitation forecasts at lead times of 24–36 hours and 72–96 hours, which is likely linked to aircraft operating from two bases, that is, the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. For the Pacific Northwest region, dropsonde observations mainly improve forecast skill at lead times of 48–72 hours. The timing differences in improvements between the two regions in 2022/23 are associated with the southward propagation of error reductions in the large‐scale flow. The smaller dropsonde impacts in 2023/24 compared to 2022/23 can be partly explained by the long data assimilation window used in 2023/24. The dropsonde impacts in the Global Forecast System (GFS) are consistent with those in IFS, although the impacts are larger in the GFS. Despite the overall benefits of dropsonde assimilation, slight degradation is also observed at certain lead times, such as 60 hours over California for two seasons combined, warranting further investigation.","The article focuses on atmospheric rivers, precipitation forecasts, and the impact of dropsonde data on weather forecasting models.",Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society,2025,,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.70019,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Fish guidance efficiency was influenced most strongly by fish size and approach velocity, with poor efficiency for small fish at high velocities. Low velocities and, to a lesser extent, daylight conditions allowed a greater proportion of fish to remain upstream of the louver at all sizes. High velocities resulted in the greatest contact rate between the sturgeon and louver face.

The Yolo Bypass is a broad floodplain of the Sacramento River that floods in about 30% of years in response to large, uncontrolled runoff events. We analyzed data from an acoustic telemetry study conducted in winter 2016 to estimate the proportion of tagged juvenile Chinook Salmon entrained from the Sacramento River into the Yolo Bypass and their spatial distribution within the Yolo Bypass. In addition, we compared survival and travel time of Chinook Salmon that migrated through the Yolo Bypass to those migrating via alternative non‐floodplain migration routes at varying stages of a flood event that activated the Yolo Bypass. We found that entrainment into the Yolo Bypass ranged from 1% to 80% among different release groups, with the highest entrainment coinciding with the peak of the March 2016 flooding event. Survival for Chinook Salmon migrating through the Yolo Bypass was similar to survival of those migrating through main‐stem migration routes. At the relatively high flows necessary to enable flooding of the Yolo Bypass, survival estimates varied little among release groups and migration routes. Furthermore, mean daily survival rates for Chinook Salmon migrating through the flooded Yolo Bypass were comparable to those of fish migrating through the other non‐floodplain routes. Median travel times remained relatively constant during various stages of flooding in the Yolo Bypass. This research should help managers to better understand the potential costs and benefits to floodplain restoration and routing of migrating Chinook Salmon into off‐channel habitat.","Studies Chinook Salmon population dynamics, migration, and floodplain use for management.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,2021,150,1,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10271,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,9,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This has led to mounting calls from natural resource managers for more robust predictions of invasive species distributions to anticipate threats to species of concern and implement proactive conservation and restoration actions. Here, we applied recent advances in fish sampling and statistical modeling in river networks to estimate the current and future watershed‐scale spatial distribution of nonnative Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu . Methods We integrated a spatial stream network (SSN) model of stream temperature, landscape environmental covariates, and Smallmouth Bass occurrence data based on environmental DNA (eDNA) detections to develop an SSN species distribution model (SDM) representing current Smallmouth Bass distributions in the Chehalis River, Washington State, a large coastal river basin of ongoing watershed‐scale restoration. The SDM was informed by spatially intensive eDNA sampling from 135 locations in the main stem and major tributaries. We then applied downscaled climate change projections to the SSN SDM to predict Smallmouth Bass range expansion in the basin by late century. Result We identified high levels of spatial autocorrelation at hydrological distances of ≤10 km in our eDNA data set, underscoring the importance of applying an SSN modeling framework. Stream temperature was identified as the most important environmental covariate explaining variability in Smallmouth Bass occurrence. Model predictions estimated that current suitable summer habitat for Smallmouth Bass habitat spans 681 km and is projected to nearly double by late century (1333 km) under a moderate climate change scenario. Current and future suitable habitat for Smallmouth Bass is prevalent in important tributaries for spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha , a species of major conservation concern in the Chehalis River and more broadly along the Pacific coast. In both the main stem and tributaries, the SSN SDM predictions of the upstream leading edges of Smallmouth Bass closely align with (within 4.8 km) edges identified by spatially intensive eDNA sampling.

Projected changes in these parameters have been repeatedly observed to stress the physiological limits and plasticity of many marine species from the molecular to organismal levels. High latitude oceans are among the fastest changing ecosystems; therefore, polar species are projected to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change. Antarctic species are particularly sensitive to environmental change, having evolved for millions of years under stable ocean conditions. Otoliths, calcified structures found in a fish’s inner ear used to sense movement and direction, have been shown to be affected by both warming and CO 2 -acidified seawater in temperate and tropical fishes but there is no work to date on Antarctic fishes. In this study, juvenile emerald rockcod ( Trematomus bernacchii ) were exposed to projected seawater warming and CO 2 -acidification for the year 2100 over 28 days. Sagittal otoliths were analyzed for changes in area, perimeter, length, width and shape. We found ocean warming increased the growth rate of otoliths, while CO 2 -acidified seawater and the interaction of warming and acidification did not have an effect on otolith development. Elevated temperature also altered the shape of otoliths. If otolith development is altered under future warming scenarios, sensory functions such as hearing, orientation, and movement may potentially be impaired. Changes in these basic somatic abilities could have broad implications for the general capabilities and ecology of early life stages of Antarctic fishes.",Studies the physiological response of a marine fish species to ocean warming and acidification.,Polar Biology,2021,44,9,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02923-3,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-021-02923-3.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In more rare cases, phase shifts result in sponge, zoantharian or other dominant species. In Ulithi Atoll, Federated States of Micronesia, we have documented an unusual phase shift from reefs with a diverse stony coral assemblage to reefs dominated by a single species of stony coral: Montipora sp.—a coral-to-coral phase shift. This monospecific type of reef lowers fish diversity and biomass, impacting both ecological integrity, and livelihoods of reef-dependent human communities. In this study, we used a genomic approach to characterize such a reef. We assembled a de-novo reference genome and used RAD seq data with thousands of SNPs to determine if different reefs result from sexual or asexual reproduction, if weedy Montipora fragments are transported between islands by human activities, and if there is evidence of natural selection on specific genotypes, thus favoring spreading success. We found that sexual reproduction is predominant in the focal species, that there is no evidence of human-mediated spread, and that some genomic regions might be under selection. While such results eliminate a number of spreading hypotheses, more precise dispersal maps will be important to determine the tempo and mode of ‘invasion’ of Montipora in Ulithi Atoll. This study shows that selection and adaptation may be contributing to the success of a stony coral (e.g., Phase shift). While a stony coral may be successful in a disturbed environment, it does not necessarily provide the type of habitat that is conducive to high fish biomass and coral diversity.

Management of this spawning habitat is complicated by cold water temperature requirements for the conservation of winter-run Chinook salmon. This study assessed whether low incubation and rearing temperatures resulted in carryover effects across embryo to early juvenile life stages on scaling relationships in growth and metabolism in northern DPS green sturgeon used as a proxy for sDPS green sturgeon. Fish were incubated and reared at 11 °C and 15 °C, with a subset experiencing a reciprocal temperature transfer post-hatch, to assess recovery from cold incubation or to simulate a cold-water dam release which would chill rearing larvae. Growth and metabolic rate of embryos and larvae were measured to 118 days post hatch. Reciprocal temperature transfers revealed a greater effect of low temperature exposure during larval rearing rather than during egg incubation. While 11 °C eggs hatched at a smaller length, log-transformed length–weight relationships showed that these differences in developmental trajectory dissipated as individuals achieved juvenile morphology. However, considerable size-at-age differences persisted between rearing temperatures, with 15 °C fish requiring 60 days post-hatch to achieve 1 g in mass, whereas 11 °C fish required 120 days to achieve 1 g, resulting in fish of the same age at the completion of the experiment with a ca. 37-fold difference in weight. Consequently, our study suggests that cold rearing temperatures have far more consequential downstream effects than cold embryo incubation temperatures. Growth delays from 11 °C rearing temperatures would greatly increase the period of vulnerability to predation in larval green sturgeon. The scaling relationship between log-transformed whole-body metabolism and mass exhibited a steeper slope and thus an increased oxygen requirement with size in 11 °C reared fish, potentially indicating an energetically unsustainable situation. Understanding how cold temperatures affect green sturgeon ontogeny is necessary to refine our larval recruitment estimations for this threatened species.","Studies temperature effects on growth and metabolism of a threatened fish species, relevant for conservation.",Journal of Comparative Physiology B,2024,194,4,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00360-024-01568-y,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00360-024-01568-y.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

It is known that the UCRB precipitation is linked to an El Niño-like sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, but the causal effect of the tropical Pacific SST on the UCRB spring precipitation is still uncertain. Here, we apply a Granger causality approach to understand the causal effect of the tropical Pacific averaged SST in previous three seasons (winter, fall, and summer) on the UCRB averaged precipitation in spring in observations and two climate models. In observations, only the winter SST has Granger causal effect (with p -value ~ 0.05) on spring precipitation, while historical simulations of the two climate models overestimate the causal effect for winter and fall (with p -value &lt; 0.01 and &lt; 0.05, respectively) due to model biases. Moreover, future projections of the two climate models show divergent causal effects, especially for the scenario with high anthropogenic emissions. The divergent projections indicate that (1) there are large uncertainties in model projections of the causal effect of the tropical Pacific SST on UCRB spring precipitation and (2) it is uncertain whether climate models can reliably capture changes in such causality.

These modes come in and out of phase with each other during the season, resulting in distinct weather patterns that recur throughout the historical record. Some phase combinations favor atmospheric river landfalls and extreme daily or multi-day precipitation, while other phase combinations favor anomalously hot weather and drying Santa Ana wind conditions over Southern California.

Sea surface temperature (SST) predictors are developed taking advantage of the correlation between the precipitation and SST over three ocean basins. The extratropical North Pacific has a higher correlation with the UCRB spring precipitation than the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic. For the ANN model, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted precipitation exceeds 0.45 (p-value < 0.01) for a lead time of 12 months. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is below 20% and the Heidke skill score (HSS) is above 50%. Such long-lead prediction skill is probably due to the UCRB soil moisture bridging the SST and precipitation. The stepwise linear regression model shows similar prediction skills to those of ANN. Both models show prediction skills superior to those of an autoregression model (correlation < 0.10) that represents the baseline prediction skill and those of three of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecast models.

In four key subregions of California’s snowy mountains, we quantified the progressing contribution of ARs and non-AR storms to the evolving and projected snow accumulation and snowlines (elevation of the snow-to-rain transition), exploring their climatology, variability and trends. Historically, snow makes up roughly a third of the precipitation affecting California’s mountains. While ARs make up only a quarter of all precipitating days and, due to their relative warmth, produce snowlines higher than do other storms, they contribute over 40% of the total seasonal snow.

We define heretical WYs as those that result in precipitation anomalies that oppose those expected based on ENSO canon. We assess the contribution of ARs and other storms to these WYs, finding that heretical La Niña/El Niño WYs were characterized by anomalously robust/deficient AR activity. In California, precipitation accumulation during the heretical La Niña WYs was comparable to or even exceeded that observed during the exceedingly wet WY1998—the textbook canonical El Niño year.

Our objective was to determine if the probability of SAV occurrence in treated sites was significantly different from untreated sites. We examined whether efficacy was influenced by the amount of herbicide applied at a site, the local current speed, and the treatment history of the site. We found that treatment efficacy was positively associated with the amount of herbicide applied per unit area, but this effect was mediated by a negative association with current speed. The efficacy of treatment did not improve when a site was treated for multiple consecutive years. Finally, we did not detect legacy effects one year after cessation of treatment.

However, recent studies show that greenhouse gases fluxes from agricultural peatlands can vary by orders of magnitude over time. The relationship between these hot moments (individual fluxes with disproportionate impact on annual budgets) of greenhouse gas emissions and individual chamber locations (i.e. hot spots with disproportionate observations of hot moments) is poorly understood, but may help elucidate patterns and drivers of high greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peatland soils. We used continuous chamber-based flux measurements across three land uses (corn, alfalfa, and pasture) to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of soil greenhouse gas emissions from temperate agricultural peatlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. We found that the location of hot spots of emissions varied over time and were not consistent across annual timescales. Hot moments of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) fluxes were more evenly distributed across space than methane (CH 4 ). In the corn system, hot moments of CH 4 flux were often isolated to a single location but locations were not consistent across years. Spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture, soil oxygen, and temperature helped explain patterns in N 2 O fluxes in the annual corn agroecosystem but were less informative for perennial alfalfa N 2 O fluxes or CH 4 fluxes across ecosystems, potentially due to insufficient spatiotemporal resolution of the associated drivers. Overall, our results do not support the concept of persistent hot spots of soil CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O emissions in these drained agricultural peatlands.

Between 2012 and 2016, California experienced one of the region’s worst droughts, with record high temperatures and low snowpack, runoff, and precipitation. This study documents small drinking water system managers’ experiences during the 2012–2016 Drought. We contribute to research on water system drought resilience by elevating small drinking water system manager perspectives and expertise. We are especially focused on small systems that are not reliant on imports from state or federal water projects. A mixed-method approach ensures each data collection period informs the next to gather statewide perspectives and experiences of managers. Based on an analysis of drinking water manager reflections, the types of impacts, responses, and barriers differed based on both system size and water source portfolio. Common disadvantages that hinder small drinking water systems’ drought resilience and, similarly, climate adaptation include staff and administrative capacity; the financial burden of promoting water conservation over revenue compounded by onerous reporting and funding support programs; consumer awareness challenges; and challenges to consolidation from both local political differences and physical limitations. Systems that built technical, managerial, or financial capacity prior to the Drought were at an advantage over systems that lacked this capacity. In the long term, we found a dearth of adaptation planning among small water systems. Documentation of experiences from the 2012–2016 Drought can inform future planning for droughts and more broadly highlight needs for climate adaptation.",Analyzes human and social factors impacting small drinking water system responses to drought.,Climatic Change,2022,170,3-4,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03305-8,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-021-03305-8.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,17,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

We collected and genotyped &gt; 500 samples from across the marshes of Suisun Bay which contain the largest remaining tracts of habitat for the species. Cluster analyses and a population tree identified three geographically discrete populations. Next, we conducted landscape genetic analyses at two scales (the entire study area and across the Northern Marshes) where we tested 65 univariate models of landscape features and used the best supported to test multivariable analyses. Our analysis of the entire study area indicated that open water and elevation (&gt; 2 m) constrained gene flow. Analysis of the Northern Marshes, where low elevation marsh habitat is more continuous, indicated that geographic distance was the only significant predictor of genetic distance at this scale. The identification of a large, connected population across Northern Marshes achieves a number of recovery targets for this stronghold of the species.

To improve our understanding, we examined how past climatic events have shaped the evolutionary history of the salt marsh harvest mouse ( Reithrodontomys raviventris ), an endangered species and a salt marsh habitat specialist, completely restricted to coastal wetlands in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). We used whole mitochondrial genome sequences of 102 salt marsh harvest mice to characterize phylogeography and demographic history. Then, we predicted the ancient distribution of salt marsh habitat and examined correspondence between divergence, demographic history, and changes in ancient marsh habitat caused by sea level rise. A Bayesian Skyline Plot revealed demographic expansions during periods of sea level rise, particularly during the formation of the modern SFE (~ 10 kya), and rapid decline consistent with recent anthropogenic landscape change. Bayesian estimates of divergence time were consistent with subspecies divergence ~ 10 kya, and subpopulation divergence ~ 5 kya, consistent with multiple episodes of vicariance caused by Holocene sea level rise. Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance and Φ ST revealed a mismatch between the morphological and molecular subspecies assignment of two populations.

How these young salmon might use rooted, vegetative structure (e.g., to decrease energy expenditures) while holding positions in flowing water on floodplains and flooded riparian zones is unknown. We conducted daytime experiments in a large (24.4 m long) flume containing a planted area (9.76 m × 1.22 m) of sandbar willows, Salix interior . Flume water was maintained at 1.5 m depth and 16 °C over a 15–90 cm s −1 test velocity range. Fish were videoed using 19 cameras to determine positional behavior, including their depth, use of vegetation, and tail-beat (body-undulation) frequencies (TBFs). These TBFs were replicated with similarly-sized salmon in a calibrated, Brett-type swimming respirometer, where oxygen consumption rates were measured. Using these laboratory measurements, we estimated their swimming velocities and energetic costs associated with occupying sandbar willow habitats in the flume. As flume velocities increased and the leafy canopies of the willows were bent over from the flow, salmon occupied deeper water, among the thick stems of the willows, and maintained their positions. Even at the highest (90 cm s −1 ) nominal flume velocities, their estimated swimming velocities were only 35.6 cm s −1 , within the bottom 15 cm of the water column. This resulted in unchanged energetic costs, compared with those estimated at lower nominal water velocities.

Sub-adult movement and habitat use differed by year and age. In spring, age-I and age-II sub-adults moved within the delta (60%), river (20%), and bay (20%) regions, and by summer, some individuals moved to the bay (36%), while others remained in the delta (42%) and river (22%).

In the San Francisco Estuary, long-term monitoring programs have documented changes in overall longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) abundance as well as regional differences in presence over time. Seasonal patterns in regional presence of longfin smelt through its life cycle were developed using monitoring data and generalized additive modeling. We investigated the year-to-year variability in seasonal patterns of presence using functional data analysis to separate variability due to population size from variability due to changing timing of presence. We found that longfin smelt have a consistent seasonal distribution and that two trawl types were needed to accurately describe those patterns. After accounting for variability due to population abundance, shifts in the timing of presence were evident in three regions. These shifts were interpreted as changes in migration timing. The most variable period for the upstream regions was for age-0 fish in summer and for the downstream region was for age-0 fish in late fall. This study highlights that identifying portions of the life cycle with the most and least variability in distribution can help inform the types of management strategies that will be most effective.

Methods Juvenile salmon (n = 3033) and zooplankton were sampled across the California Central Valley Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in 2014–2018, incorporating a range of climatic conditions including drought and flood. Salmon stomach fullness and diet composition, and ambient zooplankton densities were used to assess spatiotemporal patterns in prey production and consumption. Results Floodplain-produced cladocerans provided ephemeral food pulses to juvenile salmon in downstream riverine habitats. Salmon had the fullest stomachs in wetter years (2016–2017) and the emptiest stomachs in the final year of a multi-year drought (2015). Cladoceran abundances in the water column and salmon diets were highest during wet periods and below floodplains, and decreased with increasing distance downstream, consistent with flow-mediated trophic subsidies.

While experiments in rice fields have shown enhanced growth rates of juvenile fishes, managed ponds are less studied. To evaluate the potential of these ponds as a nursery habitat, juvenile Chinook salmon (~ 2.8 g, 63 mm FL) were reared in cages in four contrasting locations within Suisun Marsh, a large wetland in the San Francisco Estuary. The locations included a natural tidal slough, a leveed tidal slough, and the inlet and outlet of a tidally muted managed pond established for waterfowl hunting. Fish growth rates differed significantly among locations, with the fastest growth occurring near the outlet in the managed pond. High zooplankton biomass at the managed pond outlet was the best correlate of salmon growth. Water temperatures in the managed pond were also cooler and less variable compared to sloughs, reducing thermal stress. The stress of low dissolved oxygen concentrations within the managed pond was likely mediated by high concentrations of zooplankton and favorable temperatures.

By combining multiple data sources (gill-net catches, gut contents, channel morphology, tides), we modeled spatial and temporal patterns of fish abundance and gut fullness across a tidal marsh elevation gradient. Channel depth, microhabitat, and tide were important predictors of fish abundance and gut fullness. Species, feeding guild, and season were also important to fish abundance but not to gut fullness, suggesting that abundance was more related to physical constraints of shallow water than to prey availability. Multiple feeding guilds overlapped in space and time at interaction hotspots in subtidal channel habitat near the marsh entrance. In contrast, fish use of shallow intertidal marsh channels was more variable and indicated tradeoffs between foraging and predation. Gut content analysis revealed moderate-to-high gut fullness for all feeding guilds and models predicted high gut fullness in subtidal reaches during tidal flooding, after which fish fed intensively throughout the marsh. While mysids, amphipods, and detritus were common prey among feeding guilds, variation in prey consumption was apparent. Overall, complex tidal marsh hydrogeomorphology driving land-water exchange and residence time may diversify and enhance benthic and pelagic food web pathways to fishes and invertebrates. Furthermore, these findings substantiate the notion that dynamic tidal marshes in this system can support robust secondary production, foraging by multiple feeding guilds, and trophic transfer by fishes to the estuarine mosaic.","Focuses on fish foraging, abundance, and trophic transfer in an estuarine tidal marsh.",Estuaries and Coasts,2021,44,6,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-021-00896-4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12237-021-00896-4.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,19,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Thomas B.

Vegetation monitoring at sites employing new restoration strategies and determination of appropriate monitoring techniques improve understanding of factors leading to restoration success. In Central California, soil addition raised a degraded marsh plain to a high elevation expected to be resilient to sea level rise over the next century. We monitored plant survival and recruitment using area searches, transect surveys, and unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) imagery. We used random forest modeling to examine the influence of nine environmental variables on vegetation colonization and conducted targeted soil sampling to examine additional factors contributing to vegetation patterns. Limited pre-construction vegetation survived soil addition, likely due to the sediment thickness (mean = 69 cm) and placement method. After 1 year, about 10% of the initially bare area saw vegetation reestablishment. Elevation and inundation frequency were particularly critical to understanding restoration success, with greatest vegetation cover in high-elevation areas tidally inundated &lt; 0.85% of the time. Soil analysis suggested greater salinity stress and ammonium levels in poorly-vegetated compared to well-vegetated areas at the same elevation. We found that both transect and UAS methods were suitable for monitoring vegetation colonization. Field transects may provide the best approach for tracking early vegetation colonization at moderate-sized sites under resource limitations, but UAS provide a complementary landscape perspective.

Growth, survival, and recruitment success are often inter-correlated and influenced by prey availability and associated feeding success. This is likely true for the threatened population of Longfin Smelt ( Spirinchus thaleichthys ) in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) which has collapsed in recent decades along with its preferred prey. In years with high precipitation and freshwater outflow, larval Longfin Smelt are found in shallow wetland habitats throughout the SFE, but variation in the availability of food and feeding success in these habitats remains unexplored. To examine spatial variation in the trophic value of different rearing habitats, we quantified variation in prey availability, feeding success, and prey selection for larval and juvenile Longfin Smelt captured in restored tidal marshes, sloughs, and open-water habitats in the northern and southern SFE. Prey abundance varied spatially, with densities approximately tenfold greater in southern sloughs and restored tidal ponds relative to northern and open-water habitats. Feeding success of larval Longfin Smelt was positively correlated with both fish length and prey density. Larval Longfin Smelt fed selectively on the copepod Eurytemora affinis , with larger individuals (&gt; 25 mm total length) exhibiting an ontogenetic diet shift to larger mysid shrimps.

Herbicides are the primary tool used to control SAV, but most field evaluations of herbicides have been conducted in lentic systems. Therefore, managers working in estuaries must base their SAV control programs largely on findings from systems fundamentally different from their own. We conducted a study in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to determine efficacy of the widely used herbicide fluridone in an estuarine ecosystem. The primary goal of SAV removal was restoration of open water habitat for endangered Hypomesus transpacificus (Delta Smelt). Over 18 months and multiple sets of multi-week fluridone applications, we monitored concentrations of fluridone and responses by SAV across pairs of treated and reference sites. Fluridone concentrations in the water were generally below the 2–5 parts per billion required for SAV control. Monitoring demonstrated that these low water concentrations were likely due to dissipation by tides, despite use of pelleted fluridone formulations marketed for flowing water environments. Fluridone did, however, accumulate in sediment at concentrations hundreds of times higher than those measured in the water. Nonetheless, we did not observe lasting reductions in SAV abundance or changes in SAV community composition.

We evaluated community patterns based on the relative abundance and diversity of native and introduced fish in the SFE and their predominant distribution (pelagic, demersal). The upper SFE experienced a downward trend of freshwater outflow and upward trends of temperature and salinity intrusion. Fish relative abundance only showed long-term downtrends for native and introduced pelagic fish groups. The most influential habitat components for relative abundance and diversity of fish groups were in decreasing order: temperature, salinity, Secchi depth, bottom depth, and zooplankton biomass. Early life stages of native and introduced fishes were generally segregated spatially and temporally, with native fishes more associated with cooler, saltier, and higher turbidity habitats during early to mid-spring compared to introduced fishes during late spring to early summer. Community ordination showed that environmental (temperature, salinity, outflow, Secchi depth, and zooplankton biomass) and spatiotemporal factors (month and depth), explained nearly 40% of the total variance.

The San Francisco Estuary has been deeply altered by anthropogenic factors, which is reflected in substantial declines in some native and introduced fishes. To track trends in fish abundance, a multitude of monitoring programs have conducted regular fish surveys, some dating back to the late 1950s. While these surveys are all designed to track population-scale changes in fish abundance, they are methodologically distinct, with different target species, varying spatial coverage and sampling frequency, and different gear types. To compensate for individual survey limitations, we modeled pelagic fish distributions with integrated data from many sampling programs. We fit binomial generalized linear mixed models with spatial and spatiotemporal random effects to map annual trends in the spatially explicit detection probabilities of striped bass, Delta smelt, longfin smelt, threadfin shad, and American shad for the years 1980 to 2017. Overall, detection probability has declined by approximately 50% for striped bass and is now near zero for the two smelt species, while threadfin shad and American shad have both experienced fluctuations with only slightly reduced detection probabilities by 2017. Detection probabilities decreased dramatically for these fishes in the Central and South Delta, especially after the year 2000. In contrast, Suisun Marsh and the North Delta acted as refuge habitats with reduced levels of decline or even increased detection probabilities for some species.

In the San Francisco Estuary, California, extensive monitoring surveys have provided insight into the life history and ecology of certain commercially important or legislatively protected fish species. However, there remains substantial uncertainty in factors influencing the vertical and lateral distributions of many other nekton species in the San Francisco Estuary, including longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys , for whom such distributional information may highly influence interpretation of existing data. We carried out paired sampling using surface and demersal gears to address three questions: (1) Does diel phase influence the vertical position of nekton (e.g., surface versus demersal)? (2) Do environmental conditions, specifically turbidity, influence the vertical and lateral positions of nekton (e.g., center channel versus peripheral shoal)? (3) Does tidal variability influence vertical and lateral distributions of nekton? We documented variability in sampled nekton densities across diel phase (day/night), vertical position (surface/bottom), and lateral position (channel/shoal). Tidal phase and turbidity concentration influenced vertical and lateral distributions for some species at certain locations. Although infrequently encountered, we documented associations of longfin smelt with the lower water column and shoal habitats, with some evidence for upward vertical shifts in low light conditions brought about by nightfall or elevated turbidity. Observed habitat associations provide insight into how interacting geophysical and environmental factors may influence the distribution of nekton and thus the vulnerability of individual species to detection by sampling gears.",Studies the distribution of estuarine organisms (nekton) and their interactions with environmental factors like tides and turbidity.,Estuaries and Coasts,2024,47,4,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-024-01351-w,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12237-024-01351-w.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,7,EXEC

Resource managers in the San Francisco Estuary have several initiatives designed to increase phytoplankton production, expecting zooplankton increases to follow. However, it is not always clear if an increase in phytoplankton biomass will lead to an increase in zooplankton biomass. We used data from 20 years of zooplankton and chlorophyll-a monitoring in the estuary to create linear models of zooplankton abundance versus chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, turbidity, and microzooplankton biomass (rotifers and copepod nauplii) for 12 of the most abundant zooplankton taxa, categorized by functional feeding guilds (herbivores, omnivores, predators). We then used 50 years of zooplankton data to assess changes in relative abundance of the three feeding guilds, over time and by salinity. We found that herbivorous taxa were positively related to chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas predatory taxa were not, and omnivorous taxa had mixed results. There were positive correlations between microzooplankton and abundance of most of the target taxa. We also documented dominance of herbivores in freshwater regions while omnivorous and predatory taxa dominate in brackish water. There has been an increase in abundance of omnivorous taxa in all salinity zones over time, and an increase in predatory taxa in brackish water. Taken together, these results indicate that management actions designed to increase phytoplankton abundance may be effective in freshwater areas where herbivorous taxa dominate but may be less effective in brackish-water areas where predatory and omnivorous taxa dominate. The increase in predatory copepods in brackish-water areas may increase food chain length and therefore decrease trophic efficiency in the transfer of carbon to fishes at the top of the food web.","Examines zooplankton food web dynamics, trophic interactions, and environmental factors in an estuary.",Estuaries and Coasts,2025,48,5,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-025-01567-4,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

However, sampling can harm animal populations. Motivated by trawl sampling of an endangered fish, we present a sequential adaptive sampling design focused on making population-level inferences while limiting harm to the target population. The design incorporates stopping rules such that multiple samples are collected at a site until one or more individuals from the target population are captured, conditional on the number of samples falling within a predetermined range. With this application in mind, we pair the stopping rules sampling design with a density model from which to base abundance indices. We use theoretical analyses and simulations to evaluate inference of population parameters and reduction in catch under the stopping rule sampling design compared to fixed sampling designs. Density point estimates based on stopping rules could theoretically be biased high, but simulations indicated that the stopping rules did not induce noticeable bias in practice. Retrospective analysis of the case study indicated that the stopping rules reduced catch by 60% compared to a fixed sampling design with maximum possible effort.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.",Focuses on sampling methods for endangered fish population monitoring and management.,Journal of Agricultural Biological and Environmental Statistics,2024,,,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-024-00649-3,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In Northeast China, ET and soil water status in maize fields often display strong spatial and temporal variations due to the changes in tillage practice, planting pattern, and maize plant density. Previous studies have shown that near-surface soil water content (θ) observations at multiple scales provide the potential to estimate surface soil water fluxes. In this study, we introduced a new method to estimate daily field ET by using a soil water flux model mainly based on the time-series of θ at a depth of 2.5 cm. The new method required a calibration of soil water diffusivity with maximum net water flux in the near-surface soil layer, which was related to precipitation redistribution below the canopy. Finally, the new method was evaluated using observed ET values over a 2-year period in a maize field, where independent measurements of soil water evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) were made with heat-pulse sensors and sap-flow gauges, respectively. Field observations showed that E dominated water loss during the seedling stage (16% of total ET). As the canopy was fully developed, E sharply decreased to a value of 0.4 mm d−1, and T accounted for about 89% of ET since the silking stage. The new method to estimate ET performed well in drying periods, while it tended to underestimate ET in wet periods with substantial infiltration into the surface layer. On rain-free days, the ET values estimated with the new method matched well with the measured E+T values, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.85 and 1.93 mm d−1. Therefore, the new approach provides an effective way to quantify maize ET.","Focuses on measuring and estimating evapotranspiration, a key component of the water cycle, using a soil water flux model.",Agricultural Water Management,2024,295,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2024.108764,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Morteza Sadeghi,3,SGMO

However, evidence of adaptation to captivity in the conservation hatchery has raised concerns about the use of captive-bred fish for supplementation and how these fish may differ from wild Delta Smelt. We conducted a study over two consecutive years to investigate the effects of varying levels of captive ancestry on the growth and survival of cultured Delta Smelt from two different domestication index (DI) groups, capturing high DI and low DI values. Fish growth and survival were monitored in the hatchery from larval to adult life-stages to determine differences between DI groups. Our findings indicate that DI can have a significant influence as we observed reduced growth and survival of low DI fish at multiple life-stages. The results suggest that the DI of released hatchery-reared Delta Smelt may affect the performance of their offspring in the natural environment.

An additional two scenarios are also created that represent changes in the frequency of weather regimes (e.g., dynamic climate change). Results from these scenarios reveal that when the effects of anthropogenic climate change are combined with plausible realizations of natural climate variability, the severity of extremes in California is amplified significantly.

The model is based on the identification and simulation of weather regimes, or large-scale patterns of atmospheric flow, which are then used to condition the simulation of local, daily weather at a 6 km resolution across the state. We conduct a thorough validation of a baseline, 1000-year model simulation to evaluate its ability to accurately simulate daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature at various spatial scales (grid cell, river basin) and temporal scales (daily, event-based, monthly, annual, inter-annual to decadal). Results show that the model effectively reproduces a large suite of climate statistics at these scales across the entire state, including moments, spells, dry and wet extremes, and extreme hot and cold periods. Moreover, the model successfully maintains spatial correlations and inter-variable relationships, enabling the use of model simulations in hydrologic and water resources analyses that span multiple watersheds across California. The weather generator can simulate physically plausible extreme events (e.g., multi-day extreme precipitation and severe drought) that extend beyond the worst case conditions observed historically, independent of climate change. Thus, the baseline simulation can be used to understand the impacts of natural climate variability on both flood and drought risk in regional water systems.

In order to inform design decisions on a local flood control district level, process-based numerical modeling has proven an essential tool to provide the needed temporal and spatial coverage for different extreme value analysis methods. To determine the importance of different physical processes to the extreme water levels we developed a process-based numerical model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) and applied it to simulate a large, urban, high-energy coastal estuary (the San Francisco Bay). The unstructured grid with 1D/2DH model elements, allows for efficient model simulations and therefore it was possible to simulate over 70 years between 1950 and 2019.

Yet, through anthropogenic alteration many large river systems have become simplified through the construction of levees and dams that reduce lateral connectivity and flow variability. The extent to which shifts in habitat mosaics create conditions that support different trophic responses that manifest in differences in fish growth across the landscape remains largely untested. This is primarily due to limitations in linking habitat features, dynamic physical processes, and trophic transfer of energy to higher taxa at the landscape scale. Here, we conducted large-scale enclosure experiments across varying habitats on a fluvial floodplain as a model system to measure factors that influence habitat-specific growth rates in multiple Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks important to fisheries and of conservation concern. Using an ecosystem approach, we reveal that landscape context, water residence time, and habitat type (agricultural, wetland, river channel) result in different hot-spots of primary and secondary food production. This variation in the aquatic foodscape resulted in significant variation in salmon growth rates and ultimate size and morphology across the landscape. Floodplain habitats generally exhibited higher water residence times as highlighted by higher specific conductance, salinity, and chlorophyll-a values. Pelagic invertebrate abundance was 10 to 100 times more abundant in the off-channel habitats compared to the river channels. The average daily growth rates of the juvenile Chinook Salmon ranged from 0.15 mm day−1 and 0.01 g day−1 in the riverine habitat to 0.55 mm day−1 and 0.07 g day−1 in the off-channel habitat. These data were used to build mixed effects models that showed the influence of chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature and pelagic invertebrate composition on fish growth across locations throughout the experiment. As landscapes become increasingly simplified there is increased risk of losing the mosaic of habitats necessary to achieve enhanced fish growth and phenotypically diverse and sustainable salmon populations. This in-situ experimental and modeling approach can be applied to other systems to develop ecosystem indicators such as habitat-specific fish growth rates to manage landscapes and processes to support resilient fish populations.","Studies fish growth, populations, and their aquatic environment for conservation and management.",Ecological Indicators,2022,136,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108681,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by-nc-nd,13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Lehman,California Department of Water Resources,,biological and ecological sciences,aquatic ecology,0.95,"The quality and quantity of phytoplankton carbon available at the base of the aquatic food web is critical to fish production in estuaries. Therefore, a decrease in chlorophyll a concentration, an estimate of phytoplankton carbon, in upper San Francisco Bay estuary over the last 43 years is hypothesized to be an important contributing factor to a long-term decline in fish production. Although a decrease in the chlorophyll a concentration is well documented for the upper estuary, the quality of carbon available to the food web due to change in the phytoplankton community composition is not. The relative change in the phytoplankton community composition and how it impacted carbon transfer within the lower San Joaquin River, lower Sacramento River and Suisun Bay, was determined with data from 6 stations sampled at 2-week to 4-week intervals between 1975 and 2017. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) comparisons confirmed that the relative change in carbon among phytoplankton genera across time affected the food quality index and the size structure of the phytoplankton food resource in the estuary. Between the first and last decades, phytoplankton carbon shifted from large volume cells and diatoms to small volume cells and cyanobacteria. There was also a shift from pelagic to epibenthic and benthic-pelagic diatoms between these two periods. Only 21 phytoplankton genera were responsible for most of this change based on similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER). Single and multivariate analyses confirmed a link between the phytoplankton community carbon and environmental conditions, particularly an increase in Sechhi disk depth. These analyses suggest that a full understanding of the estuarine food web dynamics over time in upper San Francisco Estuary depends on knowing the phytoplankton community composition and how it varies within pelagic and benthic habitats.",Analyzes changes in phytoplankton community and food web dynamics in an estuary.,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,2022,275,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107988,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,7,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,Peggy W.

Precipitation phase (rain, snow, and mixed rain-snow) partitioning in snowy basins is important for runoff forecasting. This study focuses on how predicted runoff response is affected by uncertainty in rain-snow-transition elevation and other water-budget variables. Using a distributed hydrologic model, we examined predicted runoff differences across 33 extreme-precipitation events and dry seasons during 1982–2020, through a set of modeling experiments with different sources of transition elevation and values of water-budget variables. Different transition elevations can result in noticeable differences in predictions of peak snow water equivalent (SWE) and dry-season runoff. Transition elevation modulates runoff response in a nonlinear way, with runoff uncertainty increasing during larger precipitation events. In terms of the relative impacts of water-budget variables on runoff response, precipitation has the greatest impact, followed by antecedent soil moisture, transition elevation, and antecedent SWE. A 2 °C warming would push the rain-snow-transition elevation ∼300-m higher, increasing the number and severity of extreme events. Compared to the historical period, the same transition-elevation uncertainty in climate warming conditions nearly triples its impacts on runoff uncertainty, posing additional challenges to flood control. This study provides implications for addressing uncertainty in flood-control and water-supply decisions confronted with hydrologic extremes and climate warming.","Focuses on runoff, snow-water equivalent, precipitation, and water budget in a mountain basin using a hydrologic model.",Journal of Hydrology Regional Studies,2023,50,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101601,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Michael Anderson,2,DFM

Migratory behavioral responses to localized hydraulics are not well understood and hydraulic flow features can be particularly complex at confluence junctions. In some cases, hydraulics may play a partial role in migratory routing, with implications for population structure where wild- and hatchery-origin fish hybridize. This study investigated two questions about such confluences: (1) Can patterns in migratory microhabitat selection or migratory swimming behavior in adult Chinook salmon be attributed to micro-scale hydraulic conditions driven by discharge magnitude and ratio at a confluence? (2) What is the relative influence of selectivity for hydraulic conditions compared to temperature and/or turbidity in micro-scale habitat selection or migratory swimming behavior at a confluence? The fall 2019 migration of California Central Valley Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at the confluence of the Feather and Yuba Rivers in northeastern California served as a testbed. Using two dual-frequency identification sonars, 12 monitoring sites representing distinct physical microhabitats upstream of, within, and downstream of the confluence were repeatedly sampled during two four-day flow periods (mean flow ratios between the Feather and Yuba Rivers were 8.66 and 4.02, respectively). Temperature magnitudes and ratios flipped between these sampling periods. We used a multiple regression analysis using the F test for significance and a corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) analysis to identify predictors of both detection rate (# individuals/m3/min) and percent occurrence of directed, milling, and backtracking swimming behaviors. A combination of conveyance (m2/s), temperature, and turbidity was found to perform best in predicting detection rate (p < 0.001). No suitable model was found to predict directed behavior. Milling was best predicted by a combination of all hydraulic variables (p < 0.001) and although temperature alone was found to best predict backtracking (p < 0.01), we identified a candidate model including conveyance and temperature as predictors (ΔAICc = 3.66, p = 0.02) which aided in the interpretation of our results.

In the upper San Francisco Estuary, also known as the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta), cHABs have been a topic of concern over the past two decades. In response, managers are urgently working to understand the factors that drive cHABs and identify feasible management options to avert ecological and human health consequences. We used a six year data set to explore relationships between flow parameters, temperature, and Microcystis biovolume to determine the potential for managing large scale hydrodynamic conditions to address Delta cHABs. We also looked at the relationship between Microcystis biovolume and the low salinity zone to see if it could be used as a proxy for residence time, because residence time is positively related to cyanobacteria abundance. We found the low salinity zone is not a useful proxy for residence time in the area of the Delta that experiences the most severe cHABs. Our finding suggest that climatic conditions (i.e., temperature and water year type) have the greatest influence on Microcystis biovolume in the Delta, with higher biovolume during years with lower flow and higher temperatures. Further, there are interannual differences in Microcystis biovolume that cannot be fully explained by flow parameters or temperature, meaning other factors not included in our model may be involved. We conclude that management actions to increase flow may be ineffective at reducing Microcystis to desired levels if water temperatures remain high.","Examines environmental factors affecting harmful algal blooms, crucial for water quality management.",Harmful Algae,2024,138,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102682,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Ellen P.

Extrinsic factors, such as human-induced disturbance, can cause behavioral changes which may influence movement and resource needs, driving variation that affects management efficacy. To better understand the relationship between human-based disturbance and animal movement and habitat use, and their potential effects on management, we GPS tracked 15 dabbling ducks in California over ~4-weeks before, during and after the start of a recreational hunting season in October/November 2018. We recorded locations at 2-min intervals across three separate 24-h tracking phases: Phase 1) two weeks before the start of the hunting season (control (undisturbed) movement); Phase 2) the hunting season opening weekend; and Phase 3) a hunting weekend two weeks after opening weekend. We used GLMM models to analyze variation in movement and habitat use under hunting pressure compared with 'normal' observed patterns prior to commencement of hunting. We also compared responses to differing levels of disturbance related to the time of day (high - shooting/~daytime); moderate - non-lethal (~crepuscular); and low - night). During opening weekend flight (% time and distance) more than doubled during moderate and low disturbance and increased by ~50% during high disturbance compared with the pre-season weekend. Sanctuary use tripled during moderate and low disturbance and increased ~50% during high disturbance. Two weeks later flight decreased in all disturbance levels but was only less than the pre-season levels during high disturbance. In contrast, sanctuary use only decreased at night, although not to pre-season levels, while daytime doubled from ~45% to >80%.

Groundwater management in agriculture is becoming increasingly challenging given the growing effects from overdraft and groundwater depletion worldwide. However, multiple challenges emerge when seeking to develop sustainable groundwater management in irrigated systems, such as trade-offs between the economic revenues from food production and groundwater resources, as well as the broad array of uncertainties in food-water systems. In this study we explore the applicability of Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search (EMODPS) to identify adaptive irrigation policies that water agencies and farmers can implement including operational decisions related to land use and groundwater use controls as well as groundwater pumping fees. The EMODPS framework yields state-aware, adaptive policies that respond dynamically as system state conditions change, for example with variable surface water (e.g., shifting management strategies across wet versus dry years). For this study, we focus on the Semitropic Water Storage district located in the San Joaquin Valley, California to provide broader insights relevant to ongoing efforts to improve groundwater sustainability in the state. Our findings demonstrate that adaptive irrigation policies can achieve sufficiently flexible groundwater management to acceptably balance revenue and sustainability goals across a wide range of uncertain future scenarios. Among the evaluated policy decisions, pumping restrictions and reductions in inflexible irrigation demands from tree crops are actions that can support dry-year pumping while maximizing groundwater storage recovery during wet years. Policies suggest that an adaptive pumping fee is the most flexible decision to control groundwater pumping and land use.","Addresses complex interactions between human society, economic food production, and groundwater resource management policies.",Journal of Environmental Management,2023,345,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118901,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,11,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

As CHABs increase in severity, there is an urgent need to better understand CHAB drivers to identify and implement mitigation measures that can be used in an estuarine complex like the Delta. We investigated water quality conditions and nutrient dynamics in the Stockton Channel by measuring nutrients in the water column, sediments, and pore waters. In situ nutrient addition bioassay experiments were used to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment on total algal/cyanobacterial growth and pigment concentrations. In both June and September, relative to unamended controls, total chlorophyll and cyanobacterial pigment concentrations were unaffected by nutrient additions; hence, the study area showed signs of classical hypereutrophication, with ambient nitrogen and phosphorus present in excess of algal growth requirements. A cyanobacterial bloom, dominated by Microcystis spp. was present throughout the study area but was most severe and persistent at the shallowest site at the channel terminus. At this site, Microcystis spp. created water quality conditions that allowed for a prolonged bloom from June through September.

In this study, we demonstrate that groundwater development, even without overdraft, can transform a fresh, open basin into an evaporation dominated, closed-basin system, such that most of the groundwater, rather than exiting via stream baseflow and lateral subsurface flow, exits predominantly by evapotranspiration from irrigated lands. In these newly closed hydrologic basins, just as in other closed basins, groundwater salinization is inevitable because dissolved solids cannot escape, and the basin is effectively converted into a salt sink. We first provide a conceptual model of this process, called ""Anthropogenic Basin Closure and groundwater SALinization"" (ABCSAL). We examine the temporal dynamics of ABCSAL using the Tulare Lake Basin, California, as a case study for a large irrigated agricultural region with Mediterranean climate, overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system. Even with modern water management practices that arrest historic overdraft, results indicate that shallow aquifers (36 m deep) exceed maximum contaminant levels for total dissolved solids on decadal timescales. Intermediate (132 m) and deep aquifers (187 m), essential for drinking water and irrigated crops, are impacted within two to three centuries. Hence, ABCSAL resulting from groundwater development constitutes a largely unrecognized constraint on groundwater sustainable yield on similar timescales to aquifer depletion in the Tulare Lake Basin, and poses a serious challenge to groundwater quality sustainability, even when water levels are stable. Results suggest that agriculturally intensive groundwater basins worldwide may be susceptible to ABCSAL.","Article focuses on groundwater development, movement, salinization, and quality sustainability in basins.",Journal of Hydrology,2020,593,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125787,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,37,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This paper presents a new algebraic soil moisture-flux relationship based on an approximate analytical solution of Richards equation with arbitrary soil hydraulic functions. This solution accounts for the groundwater contributions to soil moisture variations along the unsaturated zone. The new solution was evaluated using numerical solutions of Richards equation via the HYDRUS-1D model. Despite its simplicity, the new solution could reproduce HYDRUS-1D simulations for a homogeneous soil profile with coefficient of determination (R2) higher than 0.9 in most cases. The new solution offers a potential approach to modeling groundwater recharge in existing groundwater models. In particular, this model can potentially provide a more realistic recharge estimate compared to the kinematic-wave approximation of Richards equation, that neglects upward flows through the vadose zone.

We explored the framework's ability for snow water equivalent (SWE) mapping and forecasting in a domain, including the Feather, Yuba-Bear, and American River basins in California's Sierra Nevada. Through a series of different modeling experiments, performances of the LSTM model and bias-correction approach were independently investigated. The LSTM model trained with meteorological forcing (precipitation and temperature), landscape attributes, and antecedent lagged snow conditions, showed good agreement with SWE reanalysis data (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.99). However, for continuous SWE projection without using SWE reanalysis as the antecedent snow condition, the LSTM model underestimated basin-scale and site-scale SWE (NSE = 0.19), reflecting large discrepancies since model bias accumulates over time. Thus, a zonal inverse-distance-weighting (IDW) bias-correction approach was proposed to assimilate ground observations and correct model trajectory. With the bias correction, SWE estimates were significantly improved (NSE = 0.79). The zonal IDW approach accounts for snow differences across different areas by zonal distance, based on historical snow patterns, showing better predictions than the original IDW, which showed larger biases in complex terrain with a rain shadow. We observed that SWE estimates from the framework were not sensitive to the difference in precipitation and temperature forcings between observation-based data and one-day-ahead weather forecasts, suggesting that the framework can use weather-forecast forcing for snowpack forecasting. Comparison between results from monthly and daily bias corrections showed that increasing bias-correction frequency and integrating more snow observations can further improve SWE estimates.

However, conventional methods are time-consuming and limited to specific ranges. To estimate soil hydraulic properties throughout the entire range, we conducted inverse modeling using upward infiltration experiments, where a shortwave infrared imaging camera was used to obtain high-resolution soil moisture data in space and time. Because the commonly used van Genuchten–Mualemmodel is unsuitable for describing soil hydraulic properties for dry conditions, we tested an alternative model, the Peters-Durner-Iden model, which considers both capillary and film water. The inverse modeling successfully estimated soil hydraulic properties for sandy loam and loam soils, and we demonstrated that the Peters-Durner-Iden model captured soil moisture dynamics better than the van Genuchten–Mualemmodel for dry conditions. However, both models could not adequately describe the soil moisture data for the other soils. The direct observation of the water flow via shortwave infrared images clarified that the reduced success was because of violating the one-dimensional flow assumption for coarse-textured soils and the micro-heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties for soils with fine silt and clay materials.",Focuses on estimating soil hydraulic properties and moisture dynamics.,Journal of Hydrology,2024,635,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131132,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Morteza Sadeghi,2,SGMO

We conducted cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin monitoring from 2020 to 2023, which spanned California's driest consecutive 3-year period and one of the wettest years on record (2023). To assess the impact of CHABs over this range of hydrologic conditions, we monitored invasive Asian Clams (Corbicula fluminea) for microcystin contamination and used molecular tools (qPCR and sequencing) to characterize cyanobacteria in the water column. We also used solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers to track microcystins (MCs) and other cyanotoxins in 2023. During the drought years, record breaking MCs, in excess of 1000 μg/L, were documented in water grab samples and Asian clams also accumulated higher MCs relative to the wet year. However, MCs were present in Asian clams during the entire study period. SPATT's confirmed MC presence during wet 2023 and sequencing results corroborated the integrative sampler findings. Yet, no MC was detected in water grab samples at our primary sampling sites during the drought year of 2022 or the wet year of 2023. This highlights the importance of using multiple sampling modalities to provide a more accurate assessment of MC contamination, especially in large estuaries where traditional discrete monitoring can easily miss episodic and transient CHAB events.",Monitoring cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins to assess water quality under different hydrologic conditions.,Marine Pollution Bulletin,2024,205,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116585,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,5,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Ellen P.

The Sacramento River watershed and YB are a source of methylmercury (MeHg) to downstream habitat as a result of historic mercury (Hg) and gold mining practices. In the dry season, the YB is extensively farmed and grazed. However, depending on the water year, the floodplain may remain inundated for months. Our experiments focused on the role of pasture land and decomposing vegetation as a source of MeHg during extensive periods of floodplain flooding. Decomposing vegetation, rather than sediment, was identified as the principal source of filter passing MeHg (fMeHg) within the floodplain. The decomposing vegetation provided a substrate for microbial methylation of inorganic Hg contained within the plants.

The importance of vegetation was shown in laboratory experiments where there was a positive correlation between the amount of fMeHg in water and the amount of vegetation added.

A Random Forest algorithm applied to airborne hyperspectral and satellite multispectral images generated maps of macrophyte cover in 2004-2022. Two methods assessed the effects of the management actions. The first one compared macrophyte cover trends between Franks Tract and reference sites across the Delta. The second one predicted macrophyte cover within Franks Tract using multiple environmental variables with a Long Short-Term Memory model. According to the comparison with Big Break reference site, submerged/floating macrophyte cover was +40.9 %/+8.6 % (2015), +57.8 %/+12.7 % (2021) and +75.7 %/+34.3 % (2022) with the barrier than predicted without it. Other reference sites rendered the same tendences in 2015 but mixed results for the other years. It is questionable if these sites behave as true references. Instead, the submerged/floating macrophyte cover was +8.0 %/+0.4 % (2015), +10.3 %/-20.6 % (2021) and -22.7 %/-9.3 % (2022) with the barrier than the Long Short-Term Memory model predicted without it. Additionally, the submerged/floating macrophyte cover with the herbicide treatments was -75.8 %/-72.4 % than modeled without it throughout 2004-2022. These models would improve quantitative assessments of management effects on macrophytes with a longer time series of data that includes more periods with and without drought barriers and herbicide use.",Evaluates management effects on the spread of invasive aquatic macrophytes.,The Science of The Total Environment,2025,959,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.178138,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Nick L.

PSf surface activation with Air APP and subsequent tethering of PAA chains resulted in a higher degree of surface hydrophilicity relative to the use of He and He/O2 plasmas. Surface-nano-structed (SNS) PSf membranes with tethered PAA chains were of increased surface hydrophilicity and the polar component of the surface energy by 14% and 556%, respectively, and had a greater negative zeta potential (by 26% at pH >∼6) relative to the native-PSf membrane. Fouling filtration tests with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate demonstrated reduced fouling resistance, relative to the native-PSf membrane. Moreover, complete permeability recovery of the fouled SNS-PAA-PSf membrane was achieved, via simple water backwash, relative to 66%-81% permeability recovery for the native PSf membrane. Tethering the PSf UF surface with PAA chains was also enabled tuning of the membrane molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) and hydraulic permeability. It was shown that starting with the same PSf UF membrane a series of SNS-PAA-PSf membranes can be synthesized whereby performance tuning was achieved over a MWCO range of 5.5–11 kDa and a corresponding permeability range of 12.7–23.5 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1. The present approach of PSf UF membrane surface structuring with tethered PAA chains, employing Air APP for surface activation, was shown to be effective for UF membrane fouling reduction and performance tuning.

Several studies have shown that the frequency and/or magnitude of precipitation events have changed over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the past decades. Most previous studies used only one precipitation dataset and only investigated mean or extreme precipitation. Here, using 6 gridded daily precipitation datasets, we show that there are substantial discrepancies in the changes in characteristics of both extreme and non-extreme precipitation events from 1983 to 2017. Our results highlight that using a single record to study precipitation changes can potentially lead to biased results. Using different datasets enables examining the overall agreements and discrepancies in precipitation characteristics. For example, we show that almost all datasets agree that some areas show statistically significant changes in the annual precipitation maxima; however, the locations and signs of changes are not consistent across datasets. There is a relative agreement between datasets on changes in the total annual precipitation. When examining other percentiles of the precipitation distribution, including non-extreme values, however, we find widespread discrepancies among different precipitation products (e.g., what part of the precipitation distribution is changing). In fact, depending on the source of data, there exist opposing trends and patterns of change in precipitation characteristics. This highlights the need to further investigate non-extreme precipitation events to unravel potential non-extreme but ""unexpected"" or ""unusual"" patterns. Finally, we argue that protocols for data selection are needed to address the issue of inter-data variability and to ensure reliability of statistical analysis.","Article analyzes long-term changes and variability in precipitation characteristics, a core aspect of climate science.",Weather and Climate Extremes,2022,36,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2022.100433,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by-nc-nd,22,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Iman Mallakpour,1,DOP

Data from the CheMin X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover demonstrate a ubiquitous presence of collapsed smectite (basal spacing of 10 Å) in ~3.6-billion-year-old lacustrine mudstone in Gale crater, except for expanded smectite (basal spacing of 13.5 Å) at the base of the stratigraphic section in a location called Yellowknife Bay. Hypotheses to explain expanded smectite include partial chloritization by Mg(OH)2 or solvation-shell H2O molecules associated with interlayer Mg2+. The objective of this work is to test these hypotheses by measuring partially chloritized and Mg-saturated smectite using laboratory instruments that are analogous to those on Mars rovers and orbiters. This work presents Mars-analog XRD, evolved gas analysis (EGA), and visible/shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) data from three smectite standards that were Mg-saturated and partially and fully chloritized with Mg(OH)2. Laboratory data are compared with XRD and EGA data collected from Yellowknife Bay by the Curiosity rover to examine whether the expanded smectite can be explained by partial chloritization and what this implies about the diagenetic history of Gale crater. Spectral signatures of partial chloritization by hydroxy-Mg are investigated that may allow the identification of partially chloritized smectite in Martian VSWIR reflectance spectra collected from orbit or in situ by the SuperCam instrument suite on the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover. Laboratory XRD and EGA data of partially chloritized saponite are consistent with data collected from Curiosity. The presence of partially chloritized (with Mg(OH)2) saponite in Gale crater suggests brief interactions between diagenetic alkaline Mg2+-bearing fluids and some of the mudstone exposed at Yellowknife Bay, but not in other parts of the stratigraphic section. The location of Yellowknife Bay at the base of the stratigraphic section may explain the presence of alkaline Mg2+-bearing fluids here but not in other areas of Gale crater investigated by Curiosity. Early diagenetic fluids may have had a sufficiently long residence time in a closed system to equilibrate with basaltic minerals, creating an elevated pH, whereas diagenetic environments higher in the section may have been in an open system, therefore preventing fluid pH from becoming alkaline.",Study of chemical composition and alteration of Martian clay minerals.,Clays and Clay Minerals,2025,73,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),https://doi.org/10.1017/cmn.2024.42,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

A higher number of species would find suitable climatic conditions along the coast; the Central Western (CW) and South Western (SW) were ecoregions where a higher number of species were predicted. Overall, hot spots of species distribution were similar under current and future climatic conditions; however, individual species’ predicted area (increase or decrease) was variable depending on the climate change scenario and the greenhouse gas emission.

While previous studies have employed scanning electron microscopy to measure thickness before and after compaction, real-time compaction measurement has not been possible. This study introduces a novel method to quantify the compaction of membranes under low pressure (up to 12.5 psi) by combining electrical impedance spectroscopy with dynamic mechanical analysis. Short- and long-term mechanical tests were conducted to investigate instant compaction, creep, recovery, and hysteresis. The method was validated using in situ and ex situ measurements. Results indicate that the initial instant compaction (98% of total compaction) contributes more to total compaction than subsequent instant compaction (from 83 to 67% of total compaction). The ratio of creep to instant compaction is introduced as a key indicator of material resilience; its increase from 2.4 to 49% indicates that as pressure increases, creep contributes more to total compaction.

However, high calcium and sulfate concentrations in the drainage water lead to gypsum (CaSO4(s)) scaling during the RO process. This study investigated the effects of three antiscalants, i.e., two phosphonate-based (DTPMP and NTMP) and one polymer-based (PAA), as well as pH and natural organic matter (NOM) on alleviating gypsum scaling during RO desalination of drainage water, and illustrated the gypsum inhibition mechanism of three antiscalants. Results showed that 1 μM of DTPMP was sufficient to prevent gypsum scaling within 24 h of RO desalination, while both NTMP and PAA required 5 μM of dosage. At acidic pH 3, the permeate flux with 5 μM of DTPMP remained relatively stable, whereas the flux with NTMP and PAA decreased by 35 and 80%, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of NOM did not significantly affect the antiscalant inhibitive capacity. The gypsum inhibition mechanism of DTPMP and NTMP was primarily contributed by negative charge repulsion, with higher pH increasing the total charge of antiscalant aqueous species, thereby strengthening the repulsive forces among calcium, sulfate, and gypsum nuclei. In contrast, PAA's gypsum inhibition mechanism involved both negative charge repulsion and crystal lattice distortion, which distorted gypsum crystals into irregular shapes and smaller sizes, preventing the formation of large-size gypsum precipitates under neutral and alkaline conditions, but deteriorating membrane scaling under acidic conditions. Ultimately, an ideal antiscalant for preventing gypsum scaling during RO desalination of agricultural drainage water would preserve higher negative charges without changing the precipitate morphology.",Focuses on engineering solutions to alleviate scaling during desalination of drainage water for reuse.,ACS ES&T Water,2024,4,8,American Chemical Society (ACS),https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00298,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00298,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Due to the relatively low skill of dynamical models in forecasting precipitation on subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) time scales across this region, forecasts of ridging are explored in this study as a potential bridge for early warning drought prediction. To assess skill, we evaluate deterministic and probabilistic S2S hindcasts (out to 6 week lead time) of ridging events and geopotential height anomalies over the western United States in five ensemble hindcast systems. Prediction skill for ridging events is shown to be highly variable across models. For some models, longer‐time‐averaged patterns of geopotential height anomalies across the first 6 weeks can be skillfully simulated, when evaluated probabilistically against climatology. The most skillful models show modest skill in forecasting above normal ridging occurrences at lead times of Weeks 3–4 and Weeks 5–6, with some sensitivity to the specific ridge location and method for determining skill. Using the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model as a case study, longer lead time forecast busts are shown to often occur under extended periods of highly active La Nina‐like tropical convection. Model errors at simulating these tropical convection features may have a disproportionately large impact and degrade downstream forecasts over the western United States. Despite the documented model shortcomings, our results highlight an opportunity to target skillful ridging forecasts from dynamical models for improving early warning drought forecasting at S2S lead times.",Forecasting atmospheric ridging events and their link to drought.,Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2020,125,22,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jd033655,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,26,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The first site is the Walker Branch forest, a deciduous forest of temperate climate, complex topography, and cloudy summers. The second site is the Sacramento‐San Joaquin River Delta, a site of Mediterranean climate, flat terrain on a local scale, and clear summers. After testing a new algorithm to calculate ABL heights from 915 MHz radar wind profilers, we evaluated a hierarchy of three slab models to recreate the diurnal and annual patterns of ABL growth. We found that the lower ABL heights in the Delta, particularly during late summer, are driven by the combined effects of increased atmospheric subsidence and marine air advection. In both sites, the annual pattern of ABL height was strongly correlated to total daily incoming radiation, and in the Delta, the annual pattern of ABL height closely followed the seasonal patterns of sensible heat flux from a mosaic of different land covers. A land composite of latent and sensible heat fluxes obtained through a meso‐network of eddy covariance measurements and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission resulted in higher model skill, thus showing that land cover heterogeneity is an important driver of ABL growth. Model simulations show that in the Delta, restoring agricultural land to wetlands with large open water areas could result in a reduction of ABL height during those months with low subsidence and advection.","Examines atmospheric boundary layer dynamics, its seasonal patterns, and responses to land cover and atmospheric processes.",Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2021,126,7,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jd033775,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,25,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment on patterns of annual agricultural water use over California's Central Valley, using 30‐m daily evapotranspiration estimates based on Landsat satellite data. A semiempirical Priestley‐Taylor approach was locally optimized and cross‐validated with available field measurements for major crops including alfalfa, almond, citrus, corn, pasture, and rice. The evapotranspiration estimates explained &gt;70% variance in daily measurements from independent sites with an RMSE of 0.88 mm day −1 . When aggregated over the Valley, we estimated an average evapotranspiration of 820 ± 290 mm yr −1 in 2014. Agricultural water use varied significantly across and within crop types, with a coefficient of variation ranging from 8% for Rice (1,110 ± 85 mm yr −1 ) to 59% for Pistachio (592 ± 352 mm yr −1 ). Total water uses in 2016 increased by 9.6%, as compared to 2014, mostly because of land‐use conversion from fallow/idle land to cropland.

The method works day or night, and under most weather conditions, by tracking subtle thermal patterns on the water surface itself, which are present under most environmental conditions. No particle “seeding”, external light sources, or contact with the water are required. A form of remote sensing, IR‐QIV has significant advantages over visible‐light surface velocimetry methods such as particle image velocimetry (PIV). IR‐QIV allows calculation of instantaneous velocity at high spatial (centimeter scale) and temporal ( 1 Hz) resolutions over large areas (thousands of square meters), allowing metrics of turbulence to be calculated. Results from field measurements are presented, showing excellent agreement with nearby acoustic velocity measurements. We discuss best practices for IR image acquisition and processing based on our experience developing and working with IR‐QIV. Additionally, we discuss uncertainty analysis in velocimetry techniques using images collected at oblique viewing angles and pattern tracking in images containing gradients of intensity rather than discrete particles, as well as the deleterious effects of, and post‐processing ways to remove, camera fixed pattern noise, considerations relevant to all types of image‐based velocimetry.

Our analysis suggests that the strong annual trends of hydroclimatic variables in March are more statistically significant than other two months. While recent observational studies attribute the decline of runoff for either annual total or cool and warm seasons to regional warming and precipitation decrease, we suggested, for the first time, that a larger decreasing trend of the runoff in March is caused by the declining cloud optical depth which induces further decrease in precipitation and additional increase in temperature on top of climatic warming. The extra warming can reduce available water resource in the basin likely by enhancing evaporation in March. The recent cloud suppression likely results from stronger subsidence and larger moisture flux divergence over southwestern United States because of abnormal circulation patterns in varying climate, in turn leading to drier atmosphere which is unfavorable for cloud formation/development over the UCRB region.

Methane dynamics in mangroves and their dependence on biogeochemical controls across scales are poorly characterized using traditional parametric statistics. We measured the ecosystem‐scale methane flux (F CH4 ) using an eddy covariance system in a subtropical estuarine mangrove for two years. A combination of nonparametric statistical approaches, including singular spectrum analysis and information theory, was used to isolate multiscale F CH4 variations and explore their variability and dominant controls at different time scales. F CH4 exhibited the largest variability at the diel scale (57%), followed by seasonal (25%) and multiday (18%) scales. Mutual information metrics suggested that variation in F CH4 was dominantly coupled to plant activities through synchronous processes at the diel scale. Moreover, fluctuations in atmospheric turbulence and soil temperature dominated multiday variation in F CH4 through asynchronous processes. Seasonally, soil temperature and water salinity were dominant variables leading to changes in F CH4 with a time lag of 12 and 17 days, respectively. Weak links between F CH4 and tidal heights were found across all the studied time scales. Transfer entropy metrics indicated that a super typhoon event substantially weakened causal links between biophysical variables and F CH4 by causing severe defoliation and disturbing the soil microbial community. The typhoon also temporarily decoupled the causal link between F CH4 and temperature. These findings call for the inclusion of the properties of scale emergence, nonlinearity, asynchrony and causality for comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the interactions between mangrove F CH4 and its biophysical controls.",Study of methane flux and its biophysical controls in a subtropical estuarine mangrove ecosystem.,Global Biogeochemical Cycles,2022,36,6,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gb007179,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,17,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model, we vary dust concentrations in simulations of two‐dimensional flow over a mountain. This idealized framework allows us to test the sensitivity of the precipitation‐dust response to a variety of different dust concentrations and initial conditions. The model is run using an ensemble of 60 radiosondes collected from Bodega Bay, CA in 2017–2018, clustered based on their vertical moisture profile into “deep moist,” “shallow moist,” and “subsaturated” clusters. The principle impact on precipitation is to increase the ratio of precipitation falling as snow. This produces a “spillover” effect, decreasing precipitation upwind of the peak and increasing precipitation downwind of the peak. The largest impacts on the snow/rain ratio occur at the end of the event, during cold front passage. The ensemble mean does not produce a significant seeder‐feeder response, however, in individual cases with favorable initial conditions there is a significant increase in precipitation throughout the domain due to dust effects on the seeder‐feeder mechanism.

Atmospheric Rivers (AR) reaching North America provide valuable water resources, but also can produce damaging floods. While substantial research has been devoted to understanding the structure and meteorological drivers of atmospheric rivers, far less is known about the conditions that lead to the presence of dust within and around these storms. Here, we utilize an 18‐year record of the dust content of AR surroundings combined with satellite, reanalysis, and observational meteorological data to understand the drivers of ARs embedded within dusty environments, or “dusty ARs,” as compared to ARs in more pristine environments. We find that dusty ARs are associated with transport of dust from the east Asian coast to North America. Dusty ARs are characterized by conditions that are especially conducive to transport of dust across the Pacific; namely, enhanced mid‐ to upper‐tropospheric westerly winds over Asian dust source regions and over the Pacific. In contrast, ARs in more pristine environments are associated with a persistent ridge over the central Pacific, which blocks zonal westerly flow, as well as continental dust.

Despite their importance, much uncertainty remains in the detection of atmospheric rivers in large datasets such as reanalyses and century scale climate simulations. To understand this uncertainty, the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) developed tiered experiments, including the Tier 2 Reanalysis Intercomparison that is presented here. Eleven detection algorithms submitted hourly tags‐‐binary fields indicating the presence or absence of atmospheric rivers‐‐of detected atmospheric rivers in the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA‐2) and European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts' Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5) as well as six‐hourly tags in the Japanese 55‐year Reanalysis (JRA‐55). Due to a higher climatological mean for integrated water vapor transport in MERRA‐2, atmospheric rivers were detected more frequently relative to the other two reanalyses, particularly in algorithms that use a fixed threshold for water vapor transport. The finer horizontal resolution of ERA5 resulted in narrower atmospheric rivers and an ability to detect atmospheric rivers along resolved coastlines. The fraction of hemispheric area covered by ARs varies throughout the year in all three reanalyses, with different atmospheric river detection tools having different seasonal cycles.","Focuses on the detection and analysis of atmospheric rivers, an atmospheric process, in reanalysis datasets.",Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2022,127,8,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2021jd036155,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1029/2021jd036155,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,publisher-specific-oa,94,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH 4 ). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay‐Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with 210 Pb‐derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on‐site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (−280 ± 90 and −350 ± 150 g C m −2 yr −1 ). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 ± 19 g C m −2 yr −1 ) that accounted for ∼13%–23% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a &gt; 10 times higher CO 2 ‐sequestration to CH 4 ‐emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH 4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 ± 2.0 to 8 ± 4 decades.",Quantifying carbon sequestration and methane emissions in restored wetlands for climate mitigation.,Journal of Geophysical Research Biogeosciences,2021,126,12,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2021jg006573,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,38,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The AR (non‐AR) storms are dominant in storm frequency and the storm‐total P and Q for January–July (August–December) with peaks in July (August). The monthly AR frequency varies closely with the seasonal variations in the EA monsoon and the North Pacific storm track which modulate the number of extratropical cyclones. The AR storms produce most of the extreme events; they also generate larger storm‐mean P and Q than the non‐AR storms for all months. The seasonal variations in R are related to the total (AR‐ and non‐AR storms combined) P through the seasonal soil water variations, making the AR effects on R unclear.

The major improvement in imaging the targets was made in the L p ‐norm inversion step by incorporating prior knowledge.

Aided by a global AR detection algorithm, the current study explores the insights the AR scale can help provide from a global perspective. It is found that AR event count is inversely related to AR rank and peaks in midlatitude oceans. Out of all precipitation occurrences, ARs account for an increasing fraction as the precipitation intensity considered increases. Over the oceans, this fraction is composed of comparable contributions from the five AR ranks, but the contribution of AR 5 is much smaller over land. Higher‐ranked ARs tend to initiate at lower latitudes, terminate at higher latitudes, but follow a less sloped track due to longer zonal displacement. Sensitivity analysis indicates that if ARs are defined using a sole IVT threshold of 250 kg m −1 s −1 globally but with the tropics excluded, the spatiotemporal patterns of key AR event characteristics are largely similar to those described above, except AR events are more frequent by a factor of ∼1.5–2 depending on the AR rank.

The hindcast prediction skill of probabilistic AR activity and precipitation forecasts is evaluated for Northern, Central, and Southern California, as well as two sets of smaller geographical domains. These smaller domains are more relevant for water resource management and allow us to investigate the sensitivity of prediction skill to domain size. Consistent with previous studies, our results demonstrate that subseasonal AR activity and precipitation in California are strongly modulated by the MJO and QBO. The anomaly patterns of AR activity and precipitation vary considerably throughout the cool season, with a tendency toward below‐normal AR activity and precipitation during easterly QBO and above‐normal AR activity and precipitation during westerly QBO in JFM. The opposite patterns are generally observed in OND, but the anomaly signals are weaker and less coherent for AR activity.

Among the key phenomena that can initiate surface melting are atmospheric rivers (ARs) and leeside foehn; the combined impact of ARs and foehn led to moderate surface warming over the AP in December 2018 and record‐breaking surface melting in February 2022. Focusing on the more intense 2022 case, this study uses high‐resolution Polar WRF simulations with advanced model configurations, Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica topography, and observed surface albedo to better understand the relationship between ARs and foehn and their impacts on surface warming. With an intense AR (AR3) intrusion during the 2022 event, weak low‐level blocking and heavy orographic precipitation on the upwind side resulted in latent heat release, which led to a more deep‐foehn like case. On the leeside, sensible heat flux associated with the foehn magnitude was the major driver during the night and the secondary contributor during the day due to a stationary orographic gravity wave. Downward shortwave radiation was enhanced via cloud clearance and dominated surface melting during the daytime, especially after the peak of the AR/foehn events. However, due to the complex terrain of the AP, ARs can complicate the foehn event by transporting extra moisture to the leeside via gap flows. During the peak of the 2022 foehn warming, cloud formation on the leeside hampered the downward shortwave radiation and slightly increased the downward longwave radiation.","Analyzes atmospheric phenomena (ARs, foehn) and their role in regional warming and ice melting.",Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2023,128,16,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2022jd038138,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,23,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In the first part of the study, we used a CH 4 release experiment to evaluate three common flux footprint models: the Hsieh model (Hsieh et al., 2000), the Kljun model (Kljun et al., 2015), and the K &amp; M model (Kormann and Meixner, 2001), finding that the K &amp; M model was the most accurate under these conditions. In the second part of the study, we introduce the Footprint‐Weighted Flux Map, a new technique to map spatial heterogeneity in fluxes. Using artificial CH 4 release experiments, natural tracer approaches and flux chambers we mapped the spatial flux heterogeneity, and detected and validated a hot spot of CH 4 flux in a oligohaline restored marsh. Through chamber measurements during the months of April and May, we found that fluxes at the hot spot were on average as high as 6589 ± 7889 nmol m −2 s −1 whereas background flux from the open water were on average 15.2 ± 7.5 nmol m −2 s −1 . This study provides a novel tool to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of fluxes around eddy‐covariance towers and creates important insights for the interpretation of hot spots of CH 4 flux, paving the way for future studies aiming to understand subsurface biogeochemical processes and the microbiological conditions that lead to the occurrence of hot spots and hot moments of CH 4 flux.","Develops a new technique for detecting and mapping methane flux, a key greenhouse gas.",Journal of Geophysical Research Biogeosciences,2022,127,8,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2022jg006977,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2022JG006977,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,26,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Examples include annual maximum flow, baseflow index and recession shape descriptors. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to learn encodings that are optimal ML equivalents of hydrologic signatures, and that are derived directly from the data. We compare the learned signatures to classical signatures, interpret their meaning, and use them to build rainfall‐runoff models in otherwise ungauged watersheds. Our model has an encoder–decoder structure. The encoder is a convolutional neural net mapping historical flow and climate data to a low‐dimensional vector encoding, analogous to hydrological signatures. The decoder structure includes stores and fluxes similar to a classical hydrologic model. For each timestep, the decoder uses current climate data, watershed attributes and the encoding to predict coefficients that distribute precipitation between stores and store outflow coefficients. The model is trained end‐to‐end on the U.S. CAMELS watershed data set to minimize streamflow error. We show that learned signatures can extract new information from streamflow series, because using learned signatures as input to the process‐informed model improves prediction accuracy over benchmark configurations that use classical signatures or no signatures. We interpret learned signatures by correlation with classical signatures, and by using sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on modeled store dynamics. Learned signatures are spatially correlated and relate to streamflow dynamics including seasonality, high and low extremes, baseflow and recessions.

Irrigation has been associated with increased malaria risk, but risk prediction remains difficult due to the heterogeneity of irrigation and the environment. While investigating transmission dynamics is helpful, malaria models cannot be applied directly in irrigated regions as they typically rely only on rainfall as a source of water to quantify larval habitats. By coupling a hydrologic model with an agent‐based malaria model for a sugarcane plantation site in Arjo, Ethiopia, we demonstrated how incorporating hydrologic processes to estimate larval habitats can affect malaria transmission. Using the coupled model, we then examined the impact of an existing irrigation scheme on malaria transmission dynamics. The inclusion of hydrologic processes increased the variability of larval habitat area by around two‐fold and resulted in reduction in malaria transmission by 60%. In addition, irrigation increased all habitat types in the dry season by up to 7.4 times. It converted temporary and semi‐permanent habitats to permanent habitats during the rainy season, which grew by about 24%. Consequently, malaria transmission was sustained all‐year round and intensified during the main transmission season, with the peak shifted forward by around 1 month. Lastly, we evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution of adult vectors under the effect of irrigation by resolving habitat heterogeneity.

The HF‐dominant ARs exhibit migratory behavior as they are typically accompanied by extratropical cyclones. Their spatial distribution is seasonally synchronized with midlatitude storm activity. On the other hand, the LF‐dominant ARs stay in place as they are associated with quasi‐stationary circulation. They prevail in the subtropical monsoon regions in the summer hemisphere. The ARs are often jointly affected by HF and LF processes. Such intermediate ARs are frequently observed along the poleward boundary of subtropical highs. The latter two AR types are locally more persistent than the HF‐dominant ARs, implying the importance of LF dynamics in long‐lasting AR impacts.

Here, based on a snowmelt‐rainfall tracking algorithm applied to two hydrological models, we show that cool‐season rainfall provides an important volumetric contribution to summer streamflow for many WUS streams in the current climate, and this contribution will increase under climate warming, especially in years with warm snow droughts and abnormally dry summers.

ARs during 1980–2018 based on the Modern‐Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 are analyzed to quantify the modulation of winter (December–February) landfalling ARs in the western US by leading subseasonal teleconnections, focusing on pentad evolution rather than seasonal‐mean patterns. The growth phase of the North Pacific Oscillation/West Pacific (NPO/WP) teleconnection—the second leading pattern in 200‐hPa geopotential heights in boreal winter—is found to be particularly influential in modulating the number of landfalling ARs in this region. In the positive phase of NPO/WP growth, the presence of anomalous low pressure centered just south of Alaska (i.e., a strengthening of the Aleutian Low) and anomalous high pressure around Hawaii results in moisture convergence in the central and eastern Pacific, bringing southwesterly moisture fluxes to the coast and inland. The modulation by NPO/WP is stronger than by commonly‐considered climate variability modes, such as the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern. Although southwesterly fluxes are stronger over the Pacific Ocean during the positive phase of PNA, they tend to transition to southerly fluxes before extending inland, resulting in smaller overland impacts in the western US. The analysis of temporal evolutions indicates AR activity peaks 5 days after the mature phase of NPO/WP growth, as in the case of PNA.

This study uses high‐resolution West Weather Research and Forecasting simulations to accurately resolve the gap and core structure of the NCFR and provide reliable precipitation estimations, compensating for limitations of radar and satellite observations. This NCFR was supported by robust synoptic‐scale quasi‐geostrophic (QG) forcing for ascent and frontogenesis. It propagated southward from Cape Mendocino to Big Sur in 12 hr before stalling and rotating counter‐clockwise in central/southern CA due to upstream Rossby wave breaking and an amplifying upper‐tropospheric trough. With the lower to middle tropospheric flow backed considerably to the south‐southwest over the NCFR, the increase of the vertical wind shear caused the transition from parallel to trailing stratiform precipitation. The stall and pivot of the AR and NCFR led to intense rainfall with a 2‐day precipitation accumulation greater than 300 mm over central CA. In addition, under the potential instability and frontogenesis, a moist absolutely unstable layer between 850 and 700 hPa was captured at the leading edge of the NCFR, which indicated slantwise deep layer lifting and high precipitation efficiency.

We examine the most severe storms found in the CESM2‐LE global climate model ensemble, which constitutes a very large artificial record (∼1,150 years) in comparison with the historical record, to understand the upper bounds of storm efficiency and precipitation. We downscale the 10 most severe CESM2‐LE storms (by precipitation totals), and identify key storm attributes (vertical motion, convection and convergence) that control precipitation efficiency. In comparison with historical storms, we find that CESM‐LE storms can have 30% higher efficiency and 32% higher precipitation, but produce only 8% higher PMP estimates, suggesting some convergence of model ensemble and historical storms in terms of PMP. The understanding of the controls on storm efficiency that our work provides leverages past work focused on moisture and supports the development of more reliable PMP storm amplification guidance.","Study of atmospheric processes, storm efficiency, and precipitation for Probable Maximum Precipitation estimation.",Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2024,129,24,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jd040055,,TRUE,FALSE,closed,cc-by,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Increases in the quantity of available measurements, particularly high‐resolution remote sensing observational data products from satellites, are valuable inputs for improving those initial condition estimates. However, the traditional data assimilation methods for integrating observations into forecast models are computationally expensive. This makes incorporating dense observations into operational forecast systems challenging, and it is often prohibitively time‐consuming. Additionally, high‐resolution observations often have correlated observation errors which are difficult to estimate and create problems for assimilation systems. As a result, large quantities of data are discarded and not used for state initialization. Using the Lorenz‐96 system for testing, we demonstrate that a simple machine learning method can be trained to assimilate high‐resolution data. Using it to do so improves both initial conditions and forecast accuracy. Compared to using the Ensemble Kalman Filter with high‐resolution observations ignored, our augmented method has an average root‐mean‐squared error reduced by 37%. Ensemble forecasts using initial conditions generated by the augmented method are more accurate and reliable at up to 10 days of forecast lead time.",Improves numerical weather prediction and forecast skill using a machine learning data assimilation method.,Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems,2024,16,1,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ms003774,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2023MS003774,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,7,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

We analyze head records, utilizing a novel approach that assimilates change in head data from multiple overlapping time periods, to produce an 80‐year record of change in head over both the historical and modern regions of greatest subsidence. We then calibrate a deformation model to fit both historical (measured with leveling surveys) and modern (measured with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, or InSAR) data sets. We find that the stress history of the Kettleman City/Los Banos region with historically high subsidence plays a large role in reducing modern subsidence in that region, while declining heads in both regions are likely to result in major subsidence over the next several decades.

These studies follow two approaches: (a) top‐down studies are driven by projections of future climate change provided by downscaled general circulation models (GCMs); and (b) bottom‐up studies are driven by the systematic evaluation of exploratory scenarios. Top‐down approaches produce realistic scenarios rooted in the simulation of thermodynamic and dynamic processes represented in GCMs, but the internal resolution of these processes make it difficult to link vulnerabilities to discrete components of change. Bottom‐up approaches link vulnerabilities to discrete components of change through the structured evaluation of exploratory scenarios, but the lack of insight rooted in climate change processes can lead to the development of implausible scenarios. This paper evaluates exploratory scenarios developed through thermodynamic and dynamical guided perturbations motivated by GCM‐bound insights. The result is a hybrid approach that bridges a gap between top‐down and bottom‐up approaches. This yields several advantages. First, emerging vulnerabilities are linked to distinct thermodynamic and dynamic processes that are modeled in GCMs with differential likelihoods and plausible ranges of change. Second, the structured evaluation of process‐informed exploratory scenarios link system vulnerabilities to distinct components of climate change. An illustrative case study demonstrates perturbations linked to thermodynamic and dynamical processes have a large impact on stakeholder‐defined flood and drought performance, and the structured evaluation of process‐informed exploratory scenarios find nuanced infrastructure‐specific vulnerabilities that would be difficult to identify using an alternative approach.",Assesses climate change vulnerability in water resource systems using hybrid top-down and bottom-up approaches.,Water Resources Research,2024,60,11,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2023wr036649,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

We explore the mechanisms leading to the precipitation pattern differences from both dynamical and thermodynamical perspectives. Moist‐ARs are associated with a weaker but a more zonally extended anomalous trough at 500 hPa, which leads to stronger zonal wind and IVT that favor penetration of moisture and enhanced precipitation inland. Moist‐ARs also have more moisture in the upper troposphere everywhere and stronger integrated water vapor and column relative humidity over the ocean and the interior. Windy‐ARs are associated with an enhanced trough at 500 hPa and lower pressure at sea level, which promote a stronger low‐level southerly wind component and colder temperatures. These together lead to stronger low‐level IVT that are more perpendicular to the coastline and mountain ranges and stronger low‐level relative humidity near the coastline, despite less total column moisture.

Analysis of the lower tropospheric moisture budget suggests the dominant role of an increased meridional advection of mean moisture caused by the steepening of mean moisture gradient over the Indo‐Pacific warm pool in a warming climate in the majority of models. The enhanced zonal moisture advection plays a secondary or comparable role in some models. The stronger anticyclonic gyres to the east of the MJO convection center along with the enhanced moisture gradient favor an enhanced export of moisture away from the Equator and a local moistening at the flanks of the MJO convection center. This leads to a stronger positive moisture tendency to the east of MJO convection and hence an enhanced eastward MJO propagation with strengthened amplitude and faster speed.

However, there is no one quantitative definition for what constitutes an atmospheric river, leading to uncertainty in quantifying how these systems respond to global change. This study seeks to better understand how different AR detection tools (ARDTs) respond to changes in climate states utilizing single‐forcing climate model experiments under the aegis of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP). We compare a simulation with an early Holocene orbital configuration and another with CO 2 levels of the Last Glacial Maximum to a preindustrial control simulation to test how the ARDTs respond to changes in seasonality and mean climate state, respectively. We find good agreement among the algorithms in the AR response to the changing orbital configuration, with a poleward shift in AR frequency that tracks seasonal poleward shifts in atmospheric water vapor and zonal winds. In the low CO 2 simulation, the algorithms generally agree on the sign of AR changes, but there is substantial spread in their magnitude, indicating that mean‐state changes lead to larger uncertainty. This disagreement likely arises primarily from differences between algorithms in their thresholds for water vapor and its transport used for identifying ARs. These findings warrant caution in ARDT selection for paleoclimate and climate change studies in which there is a change to the mean climate state, as ARDT selection contributes substantial uncertainty in such cases.",Examines atmospheric river response to changes in climate states and seasonality using paleoclimate models.,Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres,2025,130,1,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd042222,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Recently burned steeplands have an increased likelihood of debris flows, which pose hazards to downstream communities. The conditions for postfire debris‐flow initiation are commonly expressed as rainfall intensity‐duration thresholds, which can be estimated given sufficient observational history. However, the spread of wildfire across diverse climates poses a challenge for accurate threshold prediction in areas with limited observations. Studies of mass‐movement processes in unburned areas indicate that thresholds vary with local climate, such that higher rainfall rates are required for initiation in climates characterized by frequent intense rainfall. Here, we use three independent methods to test whether initiation of postfire runoff‐generated debris flows across the Western United States varies similarly with climate. Through the compilation of observed thresholds at various fires, analysis of the spatial density of observed debris flows, and quantification of feature importance at different spatial scales, we show that postfire debris‐flow initiation thresholds vary systematically with short‐duration rainfall‐intensity climatology. The predictive power of climatological data sets that are readily available before a fire occurs offers a much‐needed tool for hazard management in regions that are facing increased wildfire activity, have sparse observational history, and/or have limited resources for field‐based hazard assessment. Furthermore, if the observed variation in thresholds reflects long‐term adjustment of the landscape to local climate, rapid shifts in rainfall intensity related to climate change will likely induce spatially variable shifts in postfire debris‐flow likelihood.",Analyzes how rainfall climatology and climate change influence postfire debris-flow initiation thresholds for hazard management.,Journal of Geophysical Research Earth Surface,2025,130,6,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jf007781,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

A forward operator is required to assimilate ARO observations, which are sensitive to pressure, temperature, and humidity, into numerical weather prediction models to support forecasting of ARs. A two‐dimensional (2D) bending angle operator is proposed to enable capturing key atmospheric features associated with strong ARs. Comparison to a one‐dimensional (1D) forward model supports the evidence of large bending angle departures within 3–7 km impact heights for observations collected in a region characterized by the integrated water vapor transport (IVT) magnitude above 500 kg . The assessment of the 2D forward model for ARO retrievals is based on a sequence of six flights leading up to a significant AR precipitation event in January 2021. Since the observations often sample regions outside the AR where moisture is low, the significance of horizontal variations is obscured in the average bending angle statistics. Examples from individual flights sampling the cross‐section of an AR support the need for the 2D forward model.

They require short inference times, which can potentially improve the characterization of forecast uncertainty by designing very large ensembles, which is of paramount importance for for example, extreme events, and critical for various socio‐economic sectors. Here we propose a novel ensemble design for NWMs spanning two main sources of uncertainty: model uncertainty and initial condition uncertainty. For the model uncertainty, we propose an effective strategy for creating a diverse ensemble of NWMs that captures uncertainty in key model parameters. For the initial condition uncertainty, we explore the “breeding of growing modes” for the first time on NWMs, a technique traditionally used for operational numerical weather predictions to estimate the initial condition uncertainty. The combination of these two types of uncertainty produces an ensemble of NWM‐based forecasts that is shown to improve upon benchmark probabilistic NWM and is competitive with the 50‐member ensemble of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), in terms of both error and calibration.

In contrast to conventional parametric PTFs developed for specific SWRC models, the PINN learns a non‐specific form of the SWRC from both measurements and physical constraints imposed during the training process. This approach allows the estimated SWRC to maintain its physical integrity from saturation to oven‐dry conditions, even in scenarios with sparse data. The new approach is particularly effective for tackling the challenges encountered in developing PTFs on large SWRC data sets, which often have an imbalance toward the wet‐end () and include numerous samples with limited and unevenly distributed measurements, many of which do not meet the requirements to fit traditional SWRC models. We compared the performance of the PINN with that of a conventional physics‐agnostic neural network using a data set of 4,200 soil samples. While both networks performed similarly at the wet‐end where data are abundant, with RMSE values of around 0.041 m 3 m −3 , the PINN excelled at the dry‐end () where data are sparse and unevenly distributed, achieving a normalized RMSE of 0.172 (RMSE = 0.0045 m 3 m −3 ) compared to a normalized RMSE of 0.522 (RMSE = 0.0136 m 3 m −3 ) for the conventional neural network.

The former predicts streamflow at basin outlets whereas the latter presents a discretized product that seamlessly covers rivers in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Both versions use neural networks to provide a multiscale parameterization and process‐based equations to provide a structural backbone, which were trained simultaneously (“end‐to‐end”) on 2,807 basins across the CONUS and evaluated on 4,997 basins.

This study provides unequivocal evidence of the wet troposphere's impact on InSAR phase measurements by examining spatial patterns in NOAA NEXRAD weather radar reflectivity and interferometric phase outliers. We utilize a feature‐comparison approach with reflectivity data from NEXRAD radar stations to identify artifacts from wet tropospheric delays in InSAR phase measurements derived from rapid repeat‐pass data acquired by UAVSAR L‐band SAR. NEXRAD's 5‐min scanning interval, compared to UAVSAR's 30‐min revisit time, enabled detection of phase artifacts caused by fast‐moving and developing clouds. We identify regions in InSAR interferograms with troposphere‐induced phase artifacts by matching features common to InSAR phase outlier masks and NEXRAD high reflectivity masks. Matched results between InSAR phase noise and NEXRAD reflectivity show phase delays of up to 25 radians in L‐band, corresponding to 48 cm of delay.

Anadromous fish migrations can have broad scale impacts on human communities and marine, aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, isolating the effects of climate change on the timing of life stage transitions for anadromous fish species is challenging. Striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ) exhibit striking variation in migration patterns within their natural range, including migratory behaviors that change with latitude, and climate-induced temperature changes are predicted to drive future habitat and distribution changes. Here we explore the linkages between migration and multiple components of coastal and inland aquatic ecosystems impacted by climate change. By leveraging environmental and fisheries monitoring which began in 1969, we describe the upstream migration timing of non-native adult Striped bass influenced by estuary outflow and sea surface temperature in the San Francisco Bay-Delta, California. Striped bass migrated later in years when Delta outflow was greater and sea surface temperature was cooler. It is likely that temperature thresholds in the ocean during the springtime provide a cue for Striped bass to initiate migration, but sea surface temperature may also represent composite climatic trends influencing Striped bass. Further, the observed variation in migration timing of adult Striped bass has implications for predation risk on the seaward-migration of juvenile Chinook salmon.","Study of fish migration patterns in relation to environmental factors, with implications for fisheries management.",Scientific Reports,2021,11,1,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80517-5,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80517-5.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,25,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Pascale Goertler,1,

California's Tulare Basin is no exception, experiencing about a meter of subsidence between 2015 and 2020. However, understanding the relationship between changes in groundwater volumes and ground deformation has proven difficult. We employ surface displacement measurements from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and gravimetric estimates of terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair to characterize the hydrological dynamics within the Tulare basin. The removal of the long-term aquifer compaction from the InSAR time series reveals coherent short-term variations that correlate with hydrological features. For example, in the winter of 2018-2019 uplift is observed at the confluence of several rivers and streams that drain into the southeastern edge of the basin. These observations, combined with estimates of mass changes obtained from the orbiting GRACE satellites, form the basis for imaging the monthly spatial variations in water volumes.

As weather measurement systems (multiband satellite, radar, etc) continue to dramatically improve, increasingly complex time-dependent multivariate 3D datasets offer the potential to inform such problems but pose an increasingly daunting computational challenge. Here we describe the application to global weather systems of a novel computational method called the Entropy Field Decomposition (EFD) capable of efficiently characterizing coherent spatiotemporal structures in non-linear multivariate interacting physical systems. Using the EFD derived system configurations, we demonstrate the application of a second novel computational method called Space-Time Information Trajectories (STITs) that reveal how spatiotemporal coherences are dynamically connected. The method is demonstrated on the specific phenomenon known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) which are a prime example of a highly coherent, in both space and time, severe weather phenomenon whose generation and persistence are influenced by weather dynamics on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The EFD reveals how the interacting wind vector field and humidity scalar field couple to produce ARs, while the resulting STITS reveal the linkage between ARs and large-scale planetary circulations. The focus on ARs is also motivated by their devastating social and economic effects that have made them the subject of increasing scientific investigation to which the EFD may offer new insights.

Observational evidence presented here through composite analysis indicates that compound extreme frequency is linked to the Madden-Julian oscillation, a unique type of organized tropical convection varying primarily on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales. The linkage between Madden-Julian oscillation and compound extremes is largely dependent on ENSO phases, which can be seen through different magnitudes or changes in sign of the canonical relationship conditioned on ENSO states.

To address this capability gap, we develop a seasonal forecasting system that leverages the long-term memory of leading global and basin-scale modes of sea surface temperature variability. This approach focuses on characterizing and capitalizing on the spatiotemporal evolution of predictor modes over multiple antecedent seasons, instead of the customary use of predictive information from just the current season. Another distinctive methodological feature is the incorporation of sources of predictability spanning multiple timescales, from interannual to decadal-multidecadal. An evaluation of the forecast system’s performance from cross-validation analyses demonstrates skill over core winter precipitation regions—California, Pacific Northwest, and the Upper Colorado River basin.

DAS has been used for over a decade as a low-cost sensor for infrastructure monitoring in oil and gas pipelines. For confidence in DAS as an infrastructure monitoring system, it is important to recognize signal changes with time due to environmental effects. Previous research has explored the long-term changes in system performance. The purpose of this research is to document changes in DAS performance, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels (dBs) as the performance metric, for five data collections throughout each of two days approximately one month apart. One day was dry, and the other day was wet, having experienced over 3 in. (80 mm) of rainfall. The DAS system is installed in a trench containing gravel, sand, flowable fill, and native loess sections. Moisture and temperature sensors in each fill material report hourly average volumetric water content and soil temperature, while a nearby weather station collects hourly rainfall and air temperature data. A calibrated hammer on a metal plate was used to generate seismic waves directly above portions of the array in each fill material, thereby inducing vibrational strains in the fiber-optic cable. These signals were then compared to the noise in the associated cable section immediately before the hammer strike sequence. Results show significant changes in SNR values throughout the day. Consistent with previous research, the gravel trench had the strongest SNR, and the flowable fill had the weakest. While the test trenches were fully saturated on both study days, SNRs on the dry day (a day without precipitation) averaged several dBs higher than on the wet day (a day with precipitation). Variations in SNR within a material over the course of the day were significantly greater on the wet day than the dry day, but the variations within the day do not seem to be correlated to temperature or active rainfall.

Many researchers used photogrammetry to measure the soil volumes in laboratory tests.

This paper presents a feasibility study on developing a multi-security camera photogrammetric method to reconstruct the 3-D models of the soil sample and track the continuous deformations of soil specimen during triaxial testing. Sixteen low-cost security cameras are installed to the steel ring around the triaxial test equipment. Coded targets are posted on the surface of the acrylic chamber and frame rods. The membrane is printed with coded targets. There are two stages for the proposed method. The first stage involves performing single camera-based photogrammetry before the triaxial test. A MATLAB program is developed to detect the coded targets automatically. Then, these coded target detection results are fed to a three-dimensional reconstruction program to determine the three-dimensional points in the air. The stations for each security camera can be back calculated. These camera stations will be used in the next stage for three-dimensional reconstruction. After that, multiple ray tracings are applied to determine the three-dimensional points on the soil specimen under water. The second stage for the proposed method involves multi-camera-based photogrammetry during the triaxial test. The security cameras record the whole testing process synchronously from multiple locations and orientations. Image processing is used to track the centroids of the coded targets. Ray tracings are applied again to determine the three-dimensional points on the soil specimens during the triaxial testing. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can obtain accurate 3-D model of the soil specimen using relatively low-cost security cameras.

One-dimensional analytical methods are available to estimate the settlement of embankments; however, the lateral displacement is more difficult to determine. Numerical modeling is typically required to predict lateral deformation. Instrumented test embankments can be modeled to evaluate the efficacy of various soil constitutive models and numerical techniques used for these predictions. One such test embankment was constructed by the Malaysian Highway Authority over a Muar clay deposit. The embankment was instrumented with settlement plates, inclinometers, and piezometers. The embankment was then rapidly loaded to failure. To predict and better understand the behavior of the embankment, the Dafalias-Herrmann Bounding Surface model for isotropic clay soils has been implemented into PLAXIS 2D. The model was able to accurately capture the settlement behavior as the embankment approached failure. The excess pore water pressure was measured at discrete times during the construction and has been captured reasonably well by the model. The lateral deformation of the foundation soils was initially overpredicted and then underpredicted as the embankment approached failure. For comparison, the embankment was also modeled using the Modified Cam Clay model.","Focuses on predicting the behavior of embankments, a type of infrastructure, using geotechnical models.",Geo-Congress 2019,2022,,,American Society of Civil Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784484067.015,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

With the onset of freezing, the pavement gains strength with the formation of ice while the opposite occurs when spring thawing takes place. As the literature asserts the layers below the zone of freezing show very little seasonal weakening, the freezing depth is of most importance for better understanding of the seasonal behavior of pavements. To better comprehend the subgrade behavior in different seasons, instrumentation was carried out in pavement subgrade in Central New York. Moisture and temperature sensors were installed up to different depths to record the real-time change of the variables with time. In addition, installed weather station provided the climatic data. Moisture variation from 0.14 m3/m3 to 0.40 m3/m3 was observed at different depths of the instrumentation from 0.31 m to 1.21 m (1 ft to 4 ft). In addition, the temperature variation exhibited a sinusoidal pattern with the peak in July and lowest in March. With the response of climate change in Northeast part, it produced a warmer 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 winter seasons. As a result, the installed sensors recorded all above zero ground temperature during the monitoring period. Preliminary seasonal models were generated using the two years monitoring data.

This paper presents results from a laboratory study on repeated load triaxial tests with bender elements (BE) to compare the modulus properties of base, subbase, and subgrade materials in small and resilient strain levels. Three pavement base course aggregate materials and one silty-sand subgrade soil were selected to prepare specimens at target maximum densities and optimum moisture contents. BE pairs were installed at different heights in the specimens to collect shear-wave velocity data. In addition, a pair of piezoelectric disk elements was installed in the subgrade sample to collect the compressional wave velocity. Repeated load triaxial testing was performed following the AASHTO T 307 resilient modulus test procedure. From the 15 loading stages at different stress states, the shear-wave velocities, and compressional-wave velocity (when applicable), the resilient modulus properties were evaluated at the end of each stress state. Comparisons were made among modulus values obtained in different strain ranges such that shear-wave velocities measured by BE were utilized to calculate the modulus in a small-strain range, while the resilient modulus in a larger strain range was estimated by strain measurements. The test results regress to a linear relationship between small-strain elastic modulus and resilient modulus for crushed stone coarse aggregates and silty-sand subgrade soils. The findings of this research prove the possibility of establishing correlations to obtain the resilient modulus of granular materials from BE measurements at smaller strains and enable the utilization of the small-strain modulus measured in situ and instantaneously by BE sensors for pavement analysis and design purposes.","Focuses on material properties for pavement analysis and design, a key aspect of infrastructure engineering.",Geo-Congress 2019,2022,,,American Society of Civil Engineers,https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784484067.042,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

As such, inclusion of an appropriate moisture control mechanism either during the initial construction of new pavement or during rehabilitation of existing distressed pavement can be an effective tool in enhancing the service life of pavements.

The environment consists of a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing students to gain hands-on experience on the test. In this environment, a specimen can be prepared by adding water to soils, then placed into a virtual Casagrande apparatus enhanced by animations and sound effects. After that, a groove tool is used, and the apparatus is operated as if it was used in reality. The number of drops is counted to obtain the liquid limit of the soil. While performing these procedures, the virtual laboratory automatically generates some soil properties with randomized features, focusing solely on the processes rather than the measurements and calculations. Moreover, continuous feedback is provided, such as the rotation speed or the suitability of the different specimens with distinct water contents. In determining the plastic limit, kneading and rolling actions are driven by mouse clicks. The plastic limit is obtained after the roll is crumbled. The soil is then classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) plasticity chart. With its randomized nature, the game aims to create a realistic laboratory experience. The game is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevents most students from joining laboratory sessions essential for understanding experimental soil mechanics. The authors believe that this game will allow students to perform each step of an experiment, which sometimes cannot be achieved in laboratories due to time constraints.

Parametric analyses evaluated the effects of soil sensitivity, postpeak strain-softening rate, and strain rate dependency, as well as specimen size, mesh discretization, and loading rate. The numerical results showed that the global strain at which a localization forms primarily depends on the strain rate dependency of the soil's shearing resistance relative to its rate of postpeak strain softening. A regression model is subsequently presented that relates the global strain at the onset of localization to the soil's strain rate dependency and postpeak strain-softening rate. The results indicate that the inclusion of reasonable levels of viscoplasticity significantly increases the strain that can develop before a localization develops in clays and plastic silts with modest strain-softening rates.

Following typically dry, warm summers, precipitation events and Santa Ana winds (SAWs) each occur with increasing frequency from autumn to winter and may affect fire outcomes. Aims We investigate historical records to understand how these counteracting influences have affected fires. Methods We defined autumn precipitation onset as the first 3 days when precipitation ≥8.5 mm, and assessed how onset timing and SAWs were associated with frequency of ≥100 ha fires and area burned during 1948–2018. Key results Timing of autumn precipitation onset had negligible trend but varied considerably from year to year. A total of 90% of area burned in autumn through winter occurred from fires started before onset. Early onset autumns experienced considerably fewer fires and area burned than late onset autumns. SAWs were involved in many of the large fires before onset and nearly all of the lesser number after onset. Conclusions Risk of large fires is reduced after autumn precipitation onset, but may resurge during SAWs, which provide high risk weather required to generate a large fire. Implications During autumn before onset, and particularly during late onset autumns, high levels of preparation and vigilance are needed to avoid great fire impacts.",Analyzes the influence of precipitation and winds on fire outcomes.,International Journal of Wildland Fire,2022,31,11,CSIRO Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1071/wf22065,https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/pdf/WF22065,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,12,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In 2020, newly hatched Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry in California's Central Valley (CCV) hatcheries swam in corkscrew patterns and died at unusually high rates due to a lack of this essential vitamin. We subsequently investigated the impacts and causes of thiamine deficiency in California's anadromous salmonids. Our laboratory studies defined the relationship between thiamine concentrations in Chinook salmon eggs and early life-stage survival in offspring; we used these data to develop a model that estimated 26 to 48% thiamine-dependent fry mortality across consecutive years (2020-2021) for winter-run Chinook salmon. We established an egg surveillance effort that found widespread thiamine deficiency in CCV Chinook salmon in 2020 and 2021, and emerging thiamine deficiency in Klamath River and Trinity River coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in 2021. We determined that thiamine injections into adults raised egg thiamine concentrations above levels found to impact early life-stage survival and swimming behavior. Ocean surveys, prey nutrition, salmon gut contents, and stable isotope data link thiamine deficiency to an ocean diet dominated by a booming population of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). This forage fish had low thiamine, high lipid, and high thiaminase activity levels consistent with both a thiaminase and oxidative stress hypothesis for causing thiamine deficiency in California salmon. Our research suggests California's already stressed anadromous salmonids will continue to be impacted by thiamine deficiency as long as their ocean forage base and diet are dominated by northern anchovy.","Study of thiamine deficiency in salmon populations linked to their marine prey, impacting survival.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2025,122,26,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426011122,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Jason Kindopp,18,DISE

The objectives of this study are to (a) quantify the magnitude and climatological context of observed melt rates of snow water equivalent (SWE) and (b) underpin the hydrometeorological drivers during April 2021 based on atmospheric reanalysis and gridded meteorological data. Peak SWE indicated snow drought conditions were widespread (41% of stations between 5th and 20th percentile) but not necessarily extreme (only 9% of stations less than 5th percentile). Here, using observations from the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network we found record 7 day snow melt rates (median of −99 mm; ±one standard deviation of 61 mm) occurred at 24% of SNOTEL sites and in all 11 Western states. Strong upper atmospheric ridging that began initially in the north Pacific with eastward propagation by mid-April to the Pacific Northwest Coast led to near-surface conditions across the western US conducive to rapid snow loss. One heat wave occurred inland across the Rockies the first week of April and then later in April, a second heat wave impacted the Cascades and northern California. We find that ripening of the snowpack by both record high surface solar radiation and air temperatures were factors in driving the rapid snow melt. Equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures and the La Niña pattern that peaked in winter along with an eastward propagating and intensifying Madden–Julian Oscillation were likely responsible for driving the placement, strength, and progression of the north Pacific Ridge. This study documents the role of two extreme spring ‘sunny heat wave’ events on snowpack, and the cascading drought impacts which are anticipated to become more frequent in a warming world.","The article focuses on snow melt rates, snow water equivalent, and the atmospheric drivers behind these processes.",Environmental Research Letters,2022,18,1,IOP Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aca8bd,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca8bd/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,23,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Gourevitch; Nicholas Pinter,Environmental Defense Fund; University of California Davis; Planetary Science Institute,,planning and social sciences,environmental policy,0.95,"In response to growing threats of climate change, the US federal government is increasingly supporting community-level investments in resilience to natural hazards. As such federal programs become more widespread, evaluating their efficiency and equity is essential. The Community Rating System (CRS), which is part of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), is a promising example of a federal policy designed to reduce flood losses by providing financial incentives for local climate adaptation. In exchange for community engagement in a range of risk communication and risk reduction activities, CRS provides discounts on NFIP premiums ranging from 5% to 45%. Using national-scale NFIP claims, policies, and CRS data between 1998 and 2020, we assess the program, asking whether it has been effective in reducing flood losses, how it can be improved, and what lessons it holds for similar programs. We find that participation in CRS is associated with reduced flood damage, with the percent reduction in claims roughly proportional to NFIP premium discounts. Among CRS activities, those related to ‘Flood Damage Reduction’ are most effective in reducing flood losses and are associated with a 20%–30% decrease in NFIP claims. Between 1998 and 2020, cumulative damage reductions attributable to CRS were $11.4 billion; over the same period, cumulative NFIP premium discounts were $12.1 billion. This close match is an endorsement of CRS historically and supports its future continuation. To improve the efficiency and equity of CRS, we recommend that Federal Emergency Management Agency: (a) reexamine the surcharge levied on NFIP premiums that cross-subsidizes premium discounts, and (b) allocate greater resources towards supporting participation among smaller, under-resourced communities. In general, CRS serves as an effective model for other federal market-based programs seeking to stimulate community-level investment in climate resilience.",Evaluates a federal policy (Community Rating System) for its effectiveness in incentivizing local climate adaptation and reducing flood losses.,Environmental Research Letters,2023,18,3,IOP Publishing,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acbaae,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acbaae/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,5,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The allopatric upstream spawning habitat of the Central Valley (CV) population connects with the sympatric rearing grounds via relatively low salinity waters, whereas the San Pablo (SP) population must pass through the relatively high-salinity Upper SFE to reach its allopatric downstream spawning habitat. We hypothesize that if migration through SFE salinities to SP spawning grounds is more challenging for adult CV than SP splittail, then salinity tolerance, osmoregulatory capacity, and metabolic responses to salinity will differ between populations. Osmoregulatory disturbances, assessed by measuring plasma osmolality and ions, muscle moisture and Na+-K+-ATPase activity after 168 to 336 h at 11‰ salinity, showed evidence for a more robust osmoregulatory capacity in adult SP relative to CV splittail. While both resting and maximum metabolic rates were elevated in SP splittail in response to increased salinity, CV splittail metabolic rates were unaffected by salinity. Further, the calculated difference between resting and maximum metabolic values, aerobic scope, did not differ significantly between populations. Therefore, improved osmoregulation came at a metabolic cost for SP splittail but was not associated with negative impacts on scope for aerobic metabolism. These results suggest that SP splittail may be physiologically adjusted to allow for migration through higher-salinity waters. The trends in interpopulation variation in osmoregulatory and metabolic responses to salinity exposures support our hypothesis of greater salinity-related challenges to adult CV than SP splittail migration and are consistent with our previous findings for juvenile splittail populations, further supporting our recommendation of population-specific management.",Study of fish population's physiological response to salinity for management.,Conservation Physiology,2020,8,1,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coaa098,https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article-pdf/8/1/coaa098/34835048/coaa098.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Melinda R.

While climate-driven environmental changes threaten salmonids directly, they also change the life cycle dynamics and geographic distribution of pathogens, their resulting host-pathogen interactions and potential for disease progression. Recent studies have established the correlation between pathogen detection and salmonid smolt mortality during their migration to the ocean. The objective of the present study was to screen for up to 47 pathogens in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were held in cages at two key sites of the Sacramento River (CA, USA) and measure potential consequences on fish health. To do so, we used a combination of transcriptomic analysis, enzymatic assays for energy metabolism and hypoxia and thermal tolerance measures. Results revealed that fish were infected by two myxozoan parasites: Ceratonova shasta and Parvicapsula minibicornis within a 2-week deployment. Compared to the control fish maintained in our rearing facility, infected fish displayed reduced body mass, depleted hepatic glycogen stores and differential regulation of genes involved in the immune and general stress responses. This suggests that infected fish would have lower chances of migration success. In contrast, hypoxia and upper thermal tolerances were not affected by infection, suggesting that infection did not impair their capacity to cope with acute abiotic stressors tested in this study. An evaluation of long-term consequences of the observed reduced body mass and hepatic glycogen depletion is needed to establish a causal relationship between salmon parasitic infection and their migration success. This study highlights that to assess the potential sublethal effects of a stressor, or to determine a suitable management action for fish, studies need to consider a combination of endpoints from the molecular to the organismal level.","Study of pathogen impacts on Chinook salmon physiology, relevant for fish conservation and management.",Conservation Physiology,2021,10,1,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coab102,https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article-pdf/10/1/coab102/43463336/coab102.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,9,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Melinda R.

Cardiac plasticity induced by developmental temperatures can therefore influence thermal tolerance. Here, we determined how incubation temperatures during the embryonic stage influence cardiac performance across temperatures during the sensitive larval stage of the imperiled longfin smelt. We transposed a cardiac assay for larger fish to newly hatched larvae that were incubated at 9°C, 12°C or 15°C. We measured heart rate over increases in temperature to identify the Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (TAB), a proxy for thermal optimum and two upper thermal limit metrics: temperature when heart rate is maximized (Tpeak) and when cardiac arrhythmia occurs (TArr). Higher incubation temperatures increased TAB, Tpeak and TArr, but high individual variation in all three metrics resulted in great overlap of individuals at TAB, Tpeak and TArr across temperatures. We found that the temperatures at which 10% of individuals reached Tpeak or TArr and temperatures at which number of individuals at TAB relative to Tpeak (ΔN(TAB,Tpeak)) was maximal, correlated more closely with upper thermal limits and thermal optima inferred from previous studies, compared to the mean values of the three cardiac metrics of the present study. Higher incubation temperatures increased the 10% Tpeak and TArr thresholds but maximum ΔN(TAB,Tpeak) largely remained the same, suggesting that incubation temperatures modulate upper thermal limits but not Topt for a group of larvae. Overall, by measuring cardiac performance across temperatures, we defined upper thermal limits (10% thresholds; Tpeak, 14.4-17.5°C; TArr, 16.9-20.2°C) and optima (ΔN(TAB,Tpeak), 12.4-14.4°C) that can guide conservation strategies for longfin smelt and demonstrated the potential of this cardiac assay for informing conservation plans for the early life stages of fish.",Study of fish thermal tolerance to inform conservation strategies.,Conservation Physiology,2024,12,1,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coae004,https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article-pdf/12/1/coae004/56645676/coae004.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The results indicate both seasonal and location differences, with high survival in the winter (100%) and fall (88–92%) compared to lower survival in summer (67%). In the summer, one of the study sites had no surviving fish following high temperature exposure, which peaked ~26°C. After 29 days in the cages, surviving Delta Smelt in summer and fall showed signs of nutritional stress that may be related to biofouling of the cages limiting passive food inputs, restriction of natural foraging behaviour by containment in the cages, and water temperatures that were too high given the chronically low pelagic productivity in the Estuary overall. Field measurements of upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) following caging exposures suggest that laboratory measures of CTmax may overestimate the realized tolerance in a more stochastic field environment. This study demonstrates the utility of using cages as an experimental tool to better understand aspects of Delta Smelt physiological responses to environmental changes across estuarine habitats in a more natural-field setting, while also highlighting potential limitations of using cages.",Studies endangered fish physiology and survival to inform conservation strategies.,Conservation Physiology,2024,12,1,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coae088,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,Brittany E.

We tested seven candidate preservatives (10% buffered formalin, 10% hydantoin, 50% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 70% DESS [a solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide, disodium EDTA, and saturated NaCl], 70% Excell Plus, and 70% DNA Shield) for their ability to preserve Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus larval morphology while also allowing subsequent molecular analyses. Methods We evaluated larval morphology at 1, 3, 7, 28, and 168 d postpreservation (DPP) for each preservative type by taking total length measurements and assigning a qualitative rank of degradation. For the molecular evaluation, we extracted DNA from larvae stored in each of the candidate preservatives at 1, 7, and 168 DPP and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) assays for species identification targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We also evaluated the utility of an ethanol-based environmental DNA screening tool for detecting larvae via DNA extraction from the ethanol preservative. Additionally, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of larvae stored in 10% buffered formalin to determine parentage. Results Ethanol performed similarly to 10% buffered formalin for the morphological evaluations, maintaining larval total length measurements and morphological features at 168 DPP. For the molecular evaluations, we were able to identify species via qPCR and SHERLOCK at 168 DPP for larvae stored in all candidate preservatives except ExCell Plus. Additionally, we detected the presence of environmental DNA from a single Delta Smelt larva stored in a 940-mL sample jar filled with 50% ethanol. Lastly, at 168 DPP we were not able to assign larvae preserved in 10% buffered formalin to a parental cross.

Predation risk can vary with predator density, prey size, and other ecological attributes. Threat-sensitive anti-predation behavior has been documented in a variety of organisms. Here, we describe predation risk and anti-predation behavior in juvenile White Sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus across body sizes. We hypothesized that sturgeon would show threat-sensitive anti-predation behavior by reducing predator avoidance when at a lower risk of predation. Methods We began by quantifying size-dependent predation risk within 24-h trials in which juvenile White Sturgeon (9.5–25.9 cm total length [TL]) were exposed to Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans predators (mean TL = 37.9 cm, SD = 4.6). We then documented the strength of an anti-predation behavior (reduction in activity) by exposing the juveniles to a predator when the sturgeon were at high predation risk (mean TL = 7.5 cm, SD = 1.1) and low predation risk (mean TL = 23.6 cm, SD = 1.3). Results Predation risk trials were conducted over a 3-month period starting when sturgeon were 61 days posthatch. As sturgeon increased in size, predation rates decreased sharply from a maximum of 70%, when sturgeon were 12.0 cm TL (SD = 0.6), to less than 5%, when sturgeon were 23.5 cm TL (SD = 1.3). When anti-predation behaviors were tested, sturgeon in the smaller size-class (higher risk) showed a stronger anti-predation response (activity reduced to 3.5–18.2% of baseline) than sturgeon in the larger size-class (lower risk; activity reduced to 30.6–67.2% of baseline), thus supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions White Sturgeon experienced an ontogenetic shift in predation risk and displayed a corresponding change in anti-predation behavior, supporting our hypothesis. Further research on the distribution, movement, and behavior of juvenile life stages could be valuable to identify whether this shift is correlated with migration or habitat shifts.","Analyzes predation risk and anti-predation behavior in juvenile sturgeon, critical for fish population dynamics.",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,2025,154,,Oxford University Press (OUP),https://doi.org/10.1093/tafafs/vnae009,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Here, we measured mercury concentrations, influenza infection, influenza antibodies and body condition in 749 individuals from 11 species of wild ducks overwintering in California. We found that the odds of prior influenza infection increased more than fivefold across the observed range of blood mercury concentrations, while accounting for species, age, sex and date. Influenza infection prevalence was also higher in species with higher average mercury concentrations. We detected no relationship between influenza infection and body fat content. This positive relationship between influenza prevalence and mercury concentrations in migratory waterfowl suggests that immunotoxic effects of mercury contamination could promote the spread of avian influenza along migratory flyways, especially if influenza has minimal effects on bird health and mobility.

Despite the diamond-patterned aluminized mylar material by Vivosun leading by a wide margin in both total reflectivity and lowest material cost, its plastic deformation under stress makes it unsuitable for fabricating a tarp-like structure on its own. However, attaching it as a top layer to one of the other materials as a base layer remains viable, with such hybrid reflectors projected to be more cost effective than single-material reflectors. A hybrid reflector can be optimized by making the top layer width shorter than that of the base layer until it reaches a width to height ratio with the panels of 1.25 -1.9. This metric can further be used to assess suitability of potential sites for such vertical systems based on canal width. While cost of energy improved significantly with height of the system, more work is needed to assess the lifetimes of the materials and the structural requirements of taller systems. While polyvinyl-chloride-coated polyester has much lower cost, it is also substantially weaker, while the preferred choice for implementation between CoverMax, CoverTuff, and polyester-canvas materials may come down to logistical issues of production and contracts struck with individual vendors.",Assessing materials for solar energy production on vertical bifacial solar canals.,2023 IEEE 50th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC),2023,,,IEEE,https://doi.org/10.1109/pvsc48320.2023.10359945,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Both approaches are derived based on the radar-gauge feedback mechanism. Although the Z-R relations in both approaches are dynamically adjusted within a precipitation system, one is using a single global optimum (SGO) Z-R relation, while the other is using different Z-R relations for different storm cells identified by a storm cell identification and tracking (SCIT) algorithm. Four precipitation events featured by different rainfall characteristics are investigated to evaluate the performances of various QPE methodologies. In addition, the shortterm vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) clusters is extensively analyzed to resolve the storm-scale characteristics of different storm cells. The evaluation results based on independent gauge observations show that both rainfall approaches with dynamic Z-R relations perform much better than the fixed Z-R relations.

Such changes to the environment can disrupt the connection between habitat quality and the cues that species use to identify quality habitat, which can result in an ecological trap. Ecological traps are typically difficult to identify without fine-scale information on individual survival and fitness, but this information is rarely available over large temporal and spatial scales. The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the United States and Canada has undergone extensive changes in the latter half of the 20th century due to advancements in agricultural technologies, water management practices and climate change. Historically, the PPR has been a highly productive area for breeding waterfowl. While the overall trends for dabbling ducks in the PPR have exhibited increasing abundances since the late 1980s, some species, such as the northern pintail, have been declining in abundance. We used a long-term dataset of pintail counts across the PPR to separate count data into a demographic process and a habitat selection process using a hierarchical model. The hierarchical model provided an alternative way of identifying ecological traps in the absence of individual survival and fitness. Our model also allowed us to account for the indirect pathways by which climate and agriculture impact pintail through their additional contribution to wetland availability, which is a primary driver of pintail demography and habitat selection. Decoupling these processes allowed us to identify an ecological trap related to increasing cropland land cover, in which pintail selected for cropland over alternative nesting habitat, likely due to the similarities with productive native mixed-grass prairie. However, large proportions of cropland within a region resulted in fewer pintail the following year, likely due to nest failures from predation and agricultural practices. In addition, we identified several regions in Canada where this ecological trap is contributing significantly to mismatches between habitat selection and demographic processes.",Study of ecological traps in migratory birds due to land use and climate change.,Journal of Animal Ecology,2020,89,8,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13228,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,23,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Decisions that guide successful management actions therefore rely on the ability of researchers to link changes in demographic processes to the anthropogenic actions or environmental changes that underlie variation in demographic parameters. Ecologists often use population models or maximum sustained yield curves to estimate the impacts of harvest on wildlife and fish populations. Applications of these models usually focus exclusively on the impact of harvest and often fail to consider adequately other potential, often collinear, mechanistic drivers of the observed relationships between harvest and demographic rates. In this study, we used an integrated population model and long-term data (1973-2016) to examine the relationships among hunting and natural mortality, the number of hunters, habitat conditions, and population size of blue-winged teal Spatula discors, an abundant North American dabbling duck with a relatively fast-paced life history strategy. Over the last two and a half decades of the study, teal abundance tripled, hunting mortality probability increased slightly ( &lt;0.02 ), and natural mortality probability increased substantially ( &gt;0.1 ) at greater population densities. We demonstrate strong density-dependent effects on natural mortality and fecundity as population density increased, indicative of compensatory harvest mortality and compensatory natality. Critically, an analysis that only assessed the relationship between survival and hunting mortality would spuriously indicate depensatory mortality due to multicollinearity between abundance, natural mortality and hunting mortality. Our findings demonstrate that models that only consider the direct effect of hunting on survival or natural mortality can fail to accurately assess the mechanistic impact of hunting on population dynamics due to multicollinearity among demographic drivers.

Although it is typically assumed that species use the habitat that is advantageous for survival and reproduction, anthropogenic changes to the environment can create ecological traps, making it critical to assess both habitat selection (e.g. where species congregate on the landscape) and the influence of selected habitats on the demographic processes that govern population dynamics. We used a long‐term (1958–2011), large‐scale, multi‐species dataset for waterfowl that spans the United States and Canada to estimate species‐specific responses to climate and land use variables in a landscape that has undergone significant environmental change across space and time. We first estimated the effects of change in climate and land use variables on habitat selection and population dynamics for nine species. We then hypothesized that species‐specific responses to environmental change would scale with life‐history traits, specifically: longevity, nesting phenology and female breeding site fidelity. We observed species‐level heterogeneity in the demographic and habitat selection responses to climate and land use change, which would complicate community‐level habitat management. Our work highlights the importance of multi‐species monitoring and community‐level analysis, even among closely related species. We detected several relationships between life‐history traits, particularly nesting phenology, and species' responses to environmental change. One species, the early‐nesting northern pintail ( Anas acuta ), was consistently at the extreme end of responses to land use and climate predictors and has been a species of conservation concern since their population began to decline in the 1980s. They, and the blue‐winged teal, also demonstrated a positive habitat selection response to the proportion of cropland on the landscape that simultaneously reduced abundance the following year, indicative of susceptibility to ecological traps.

In California, substantial tracts of freshwater, brackish and tidal wetlands have been lost. Given the anthropogenic footprint of development and urbanization in this region, wetland restoration must rely on conversion of existing habitat types rather than adding new wetlands. These restorations can cause conflicts among stakeholders and species that win or lose depending on identified restoration priorities. Suisun Marsh on the San Francisco Bay Estuary is the largest brackish marsh on the US Pacific coast. To understand how conversion of brackish managed wetlands to tidal marsh would impact waterfowl populations and whether future tidal marsh restorations could provide suitable habitat for dabbling ducks, we examined waterfowl wetland use with a robust GPS‐GSM tracking dataset (442,017 locations) from six dabbling duck species ( N = 315). Managed wetlands, which comprise 47% of Suisun Marsh, were consistently and strongly selected by waterfowl over tidal marshes, with use ~98% across seasons and species. However, while use of tidal marsh (only 14% of Suisun Marsh) was generally &lt;2%, almost half our ducks (~44%) spent some time in this habitat and exhibited strong utilization of pond‐like features. Ponds only comprise ~10% of this habitat but attracted 44% use (~4.5 times greater than availability). Synthesis and applications . Managed wetlands were vital to dabbling ducks, but losses from conversion of these habitats may be partially mitigated by incorporating pond features that are more attractive to waterfowl, and likely to offer multi‐species benefits, into tidal marsh restoration designs.

Understanding collision risk and the factors affecting it can help minimize impacts on wild populations. For wind turbines, flight altitude is a major factor influencing collision risk, and altitude‐selection analyses can evaluate when and why animals fly at certain altitudes under certain conditions. We used GPS tags to track Pacific Flyway geese (Pacific greater white‐fronted goose, tule greater white‐fronted goose and lesser snow goose) on transoceanic migrations between Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the contiguous United States, an area where offshore windfarm development is beginning. We evaluated how geographic and environmental covariates affected (1) whether birds were at rest on the water versus in flight (binomial model) and (2) altitude selection when in flight (similar to a step‐selection framework). We then used a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of flying at each altitude under various conditions, considering both the fly/rest decision and altitude selection. In both spring and fall, geese showed strong selection for altitudes within the expected rotor‐swept zone (20–200 m asl), with 56% of locations expected to be within the rotor‐swept zone under mean daylight conditions and 28% at night. This indicates a high possibility that migrating geese may be at risk of collision when passing through windfarms. Although there was some variation across subspecies, geese were most likely to be within the rotor‐swept zone with little wind or light tailwinds, low clouds, little to no precipitation and moderate to cool air temperatures. Geese were unlikely to be in the rotor‐swept zone at night, when most individuals were at rest on the water. Synthesis and applications .

In this study, seven saline/mineral springs with different geochemical characteristics and salinity origins were investigated using geochemical and molecular microbiological analyses to reveal the composition of microbial communities inhabiting springs and their key controlling factors. The 16S rRNA sequencing results demonstrated that each spring harbours a unique microbial community influenced by its geochemical properties and subsurface conditions. The microbial communities in springs that originated from Cambrian/Ordovician strata, which are deep confined units that have limited recharge from overlying formations, share a greater similarity in community composition and have a higher species richness and more overlapped taxa than those that originated from shallower Pennsylvanian strata, which are subject to extensive regional surface and groundwater recharge. The microbial distribution along the spring flow paths at the surface indicates that 59.8%-94.2% of total sequences in sedimentary samples originated from spring water, highlighting the role of springs in influencing microbiota in the immediate terrestrial environment. The results indicate that the springs introduce microbiota with a high biodiversity into surface terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, potentially affecting microbial reservoirs in downstream ecosystems.","Examines microbial communities in saline springs, linking their composition to groundwater origin and subsurface conditions.",Environmental Microbiology,2022,24,12,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16241,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1462-2920.16241,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Theodore M.

Simultaneous drought in all major source regions — or perfect drought — poses the most serious challenge to water management. We examine perfect droughts relevant to Southern California (SoCal) water resources with instrumental records and tree‐ring reconstructions for the Sacramento and Colorado Rivers, and SoCal. Perfect droughts have occurred five times since 1906, lasting two to three years, except for the most recent event, 2012–2015. This number and duration of perfect droughts is not unusual in the context of the past six centuries. The modern period stands out for the relatively even distribution of perfect droughts and lacks the clusters of perfect drought documented in prior centuries. In comparison, perfect droughts of the 12th Century were both longer (up to nine years) and more widespread. Perfect droughts of the 20th and 21st Centuries have occurred under different oceanic/atmospheric patterns, zonal and meridional flow, and ENSO or non‐ENSO conditions. Multidecadal coherence across the three regions exists, but it has varied over the past six centuries, resulting in irregular intervals of perfect drought.

Model experiments are conducted to test the importance of having (1) an accurate representation of bathymetry to correctly predict hypoxia and other processes and (2) a high‐resolution model grid for tributaries to correctly simulate water quality variables. Comparison with the model experiment results with bathymetry smoothing indicates that bathymetry smoothing, as commonly used for many systems, changes the stratification and lateral circulation pattern, resulting in more salt intrusion into shallow water regions, and an increase in the freshwater age. Consequently, a model with bathymetry smoothing can lead to an unrealistic prediction of the distribution of hypoxia and phytoplankton production. Local grid refinement shows significant improvement of model simulations on local stratification and water quality variables.

Three SLR scenarios (0.17, 0.5, and 1.0 m) were conducted from 1991 to 1995. Results show that the summer hypoxic volume (HV) increases about 2%, 8%, and 16%, respectively, for these three scenarios, compared with Base Scenario. The contributions of physical and biological processes on the increase in the HV were analyzed. With the projected SLR, enhanced gravitational circulation transports more oxygen‐rich water in the bottom layer from the mouth. However, the pycnocline moves upwards along with increasing water depth, which largely prolongs the time for dissolved oxygen (DO) to be transported to the bottom. The altered physical processes contribute greatly to a larger HV bay‐wide. Besides, SLR increases the whole Bay phytoplankton production, with a larger increase in shallow areas (e.g., 53% in areas with depth &lt;1 m under SLR of 0.5 m). Enhanced light availability is suggested to be the major driver of blooming phytoplankton under SLR in shallow areas. While increased DO production over the euphotic zone is mostly released to the atmosphere and transported downstream, the increase in settled organic matter greatly promotes DO consumption in the water column.

Bayesian forecast simulations demonstrate a nonlinear decrease in the skill of statistical water supply forecasts during warm snow droughts, when a low fraction of winter precipitation remains as SWE. Forecast skill similarly decreases during dry snow droughts, when winter precipitation is low. During a shift away from snow‐dominance, the uncertainty of forecasts using snow pillow data increases about 1.9 times faster than analogous forecasts using full‐catchment SWE maps in the study area. Replacing the snow pillow index with full‐catchment SWE data reduces statistical forecast uncertainty by 39% on average across all tested climate conditions.

Here we develop a generalizable, data‐driven methodology to study the migration of animals through complex physical environments. Our approach combines validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling with animal tracking data to decompose migratory movements into two components, namely movement caused by physical forcing and movement due to active locomotion. We then use a flexible recurrent neural network model to relate local environmental conditions to locomotion behaviour of the migrating animal, allowing us to predict a migrant's force production, velocity and trajectory over time. We apply this framework to a large dataset containing measured trajectories of migrating Chinook salmon through a section of river in California's Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta. We show that the model is capable of describing fish migratory movements as a function of local flow variables, and that it is possible to accurately forecast migratory movements on which the model was not trained. After validating our model, we show how our framework can be used to understand how migrants respond to local‐flow conditions, how migratory behaviour changes as overall conditions in the system change and how the energetic cost of migratory movements depends on environmental conditions in space and time.

These distributions can be characterized by their moments (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) or diversity metrics (e.g. functional richness). Typically, such moments and metrics are calculated using community‐weighted approaches (e.g. abundance‐weighted mean). We propose an alternative bootstrapping approach that allows flexibility in trait sampling and explicit incorporation of intraspecific variation, and show that this approach significantly improves estimation while allowing us to quantify uncertainty. We assess the performance of different approaches for estimating the moments of trait distributions across various sampling scenarios, taxa and datasets by comparing estimates derived from simulated samples with the true values calculated from full datasets. Simulations differ in sampling intensity (individuals per species), sampling biases (abundance, size), trait data source (local vs. global) and estimation method (two types of community‐weighting, two types of bootstrapping). We introduce the traitstrap R package, which contains a modular and extensible set of bootstrapping and weighted‐averaging functions that use community composition and trait data to estimate the moments of community trait distributions with their uncertainty. Importantly, the first function in the workflow, trait_fill , allows the user to specify hierarchical structures (e.g. plot within site, experiment vs. control, species within genus) to assign trait values to each taxon in each community sample. Across all taxa, simulations and metrics, bootstrapping approaches were more accurate and less biased than community‐weighted approaches. With bootstrapping, a sample size of 9 or more measurements per species per trait generally included the true mean within the 95% CI. It reduced average percent errors by 26%–74% relative to community‐weighting. Random sampling across all species outperformed both size‐ and abundance‐biased sampling.

Evidence for the immediate effects of these novel disturbances on wildlife is accumulating, but little information exists on longer term impacts to species and ecosystems. We studied the occurrence dynamics of an iconic old‐forest species, the spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis ), on a long‐term study area in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA from 1989 to 2020 to evaluate their multi‐scale population response following a 2014 megafire (the ‘King’ Fire) that affected a portion of our study area. We found that extensive severe fire within spotted owl sites resulted in both immediate site abandonment and prolonged lack of re‐colonization by owls six years post‐fire. Sites that experienced high pyrodiversity – a mosaic of burn severities – were more likely to persist after the fire, but this effect was only apparent at finer spatial scales. A potentially confounding factor, post‐fire salvage logging, did not explain variability in the probability of either owls persisting at sites or sites becoming re‐colonized; effects could be attributed only to severe fire extent and pyrodiversity. Our study demonstrates the prolonged effects of severe fire on the occupancy of this forest‐dependent species, suggesting that forest restoration that reduces megafires could benefit spotted owls.

One emerging conservation strategy is to identify and conserve climate change refugia: areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change that enable persistence of valued resources. This management paradigm may be pursued at broad scales by leveraging existing resources and placing them into a tangible framework to stimulate further collaboration that fosters management decision‐making. Here, we describe a framework for moving toward operationalizing climate change refugia conservation at an ecoregion scale with an analysis for the Sierra Nevada ecoregion (CA, USA). Structured within the Climate Change Refugia Conservation Cycle, we identify a preliminary suite of conservation priorities for the ecoregion, and demonstrate how existing mapping, data, and applications could be used for identifying, prioritizing, managing, and monitoring refugia. We focus on six stakeholder‐identified conservation priorities, including two process‐based refugial priorities (snow and fire), and four ecosystem‐based refugial priorities (meadows, giant sequoia, old growth forests, and alpine communities). This pilot overview of concepts and resources provides a foundation for both near‐term implementation and further discussion in moving from science to conservation practice.

California's Central Valley (CV) historically hosted one of the most diverse population complexes of Chinook salmon in the world. However, anthropogenic factors have dramatically decreased this diversity, with severe consequences for population resilience. Here we use next generation sequencing and an archive of thousands of tissue samples collected across two decades during the juvenile outmigration to evaluate phenotypic diversity between and within populations of CV Chinook salmon. To account for highly heterogeneous sample qualities in the archive dataset, we develop and test an approach for population and subpopulation assignments of CV Chinook salmon that allows inclusion of relatively low‐quality samples while controlling error rates. We find significantly distinct outmigration timing and body size distributions for each population and subpopulation. Within the archive dataset, spring run individuals that assigned to the Mill and Deer Creeks subpopulation exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution as well as larger body sizes than individuals that assigned to the Butte Creek subpopulation. Within the fall run population, individuals that assigned to the late‐fall run subpopulation also exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution and larger body sizes than other fall run fish in our dataset. These results highlight the importance of distinct subpopulations for maintaining remaining diversity in CV Chinook salmon, and demonstrates the power of genomics‐based population assignments to aid the study and management of intraspecific diversity.",Study of Chinook salmon populations and their diversity using genomic methods for management.,Evolutionary Applications,2024,17,6,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13705,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Durand,University of California Davis; California Department of Fish and Wildlife,,biological and ecological sciences,aquatic ecology,0.95,"Opportunities to enhance ecosystem functions exist in human‐dominated working landscapes, but understanding of key drivers is often lacking in these novel environments. In Suisun Marsh, California, USA, impounded managed wetlands designed to promote waterfowl incidentally support higher plankton densities—a key resource for imperilled pelagic fishes—than adjacent tidal habitats. Managed wetland operations could produce plankton at critical periods for fish and the aquatic food‐web more broadly, but drivers of plankton production in managed wetlands are poorly understood. We proposed that decaying vegetation resulting from controlled flooding in managed wetlands is important for stimulating plankton blooms, but that the effect varies by plant species and functional type. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the effects of different inundated plants on plankton production, including three forb species, three emergent graminoid species and a control treatment without added plant material. Forbs promoted larger phytoplankton blooms and higher zooplankton production—by an order of magnitude—than both emergent graminoids and the control treatment. Emergent graminoids supported larger phytoplankton blooms, but not higher zooplankton production, than the control treatment. Phytoplankton blooms exhibited pulse dynamics in all treatments, with densities increasing initially and crashing by the end of the experiment. Phytoplankton blooms in forb and emergent treatments lasted similar durations, counter to the expectation that emergent graminoids would support diminished production over a relatively prolonged period. Among zooplankton taxa, Daphnia magna and rotifers were strongly associated with all three forbs species while the nonnative cyclopoid copepod Limnothoina tetraspina were associated with cattails ( Typha domingensis ) and the control. Forbs temporarily depleted dissolved oxygen concentrations during the first week of the experiment, suggesting a tradeoff by which decaying forbs boost plankton production at risk of initial hypoxia. Our results suggest that seasonal drying and flooding operations in managed wetlands are likely to enhance plankton production because dry periods promote forb growth and subsequent flooding introduces labile forb material to the aquatic food web. Results also suggest that seasonal managed‐wetlands act as novel floodplain‐analogues, by which flood pulses drive productivity. Further research is needed to quantify production benefits and tradeoffs to the aquatic ecosystem at the landscape scale and to identify optimal management regimes that will help conserve imperilled species.",Study of plankton production and food webs in managed wetland ecosystems in relation to decaying vegetation.,Freshwater Biology,2024,69,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14336,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Previous research has shown that pH and the supply of electron donors and acceptors affect that ratio, but it is unclear how their influences compare and affect one another. This study examines impacts of pH and the supply of acetate, sulfate, and goethite on the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction in semi‐continuous sediment bioreactors. We examined which parameter had the greatest impact on that ratio and whether the parameter influences depended on the state of each other. Results show that pH had a greater influence than acetate supply on the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction, and that the impact of acetate supply on the ratio depended on pH. In acidic reactors (pH 6.0 media), the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction decreased from 3:1 to 2:1 as acetate supply increased (0–1 mM). In alkaline reactors (pH 7.5 media), iron and sulfate were reduced in equal proportions, regardless of acetate supply. Secondly, a comparison of experiments with and without sulfate shows that the extent of iron reduction was greater if sulfate reduction was occurring and that the effect was larger in alkaline reactors than acidic reactors. Thus, the influence of sulfate supply on iron reduction extent also depended on pH and suggests that iron reduction grows more dependent on sulfate reduction as pH increases. Our results compare well to trends in groundwater geochemistry and provide further evidence that pH is a major control on iron and sulfate reduction in systems with crystalline (oxyhydr)oxides. pH not only affects the ratio between the reactions but also the influences of other parameters on that ratio.","Study of iron and sulfate reduction in anoxic systems, influenced by pH and substrate, with direct mention of groundwater geochemistry.",Geobiology,2021,19,4,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12444,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/gbi.12444,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,publisher-specific-oa,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Here we present, to our knowledge, the first multi‐site synthesis of how predictors of CH 4 fluxes (FCH4) in freshwater wetlands vary across wetland types at diel, multiday (synoptic), and seasonal time scales. We used several statistical approaches (correlation analysis, generalized additive modeling, mutual information, and random forests) in a wavelet‐based multi‐resolution framework to assess the importance of environmental predictors, nonlinearities and lags on FCH4 across 23 eddy covariance sites. Seasonally, soil and air temperature were dominant predictors of FCH4 at sites with smaller seasonal variation in water table depth (WTD). In contrast, WTD was the dominant predictor for wetlands with smaller variations in temperature (e.g., seasonal tropical/subtropical wetlands). Changes in seasonal FCH4 lagged fluctuations in WTD by ~17 ± 11 days, and lagged air and soil temperature by median values of 8 ± 16 and 5 ± 15 days, respectively. Temperature and WTD were also dominant predictors at the multiday scale. Atmospheric pressure (PA) was another important multiday scale predictor for peat‐dominated sites, with drops in PA coinciding with synchronous releases of CH 4 . At the diel scale, synchronous relationships with latent heat flux and vapor pressure deficit suggest that physical processes controlling evaporation and boundary layer mixing exert similar controls on CH 4 volatilization, and suggest the influence of pressurized ventilation in aerenchymatous vegetation. In addition, 1‐ to 4‐h lagged relationships with ecosystem photosynthesis indicate recent carbon substrates, such as root exudates, may also control FCH4. By addressing issues of scale, asynchrony, and nonlinearity, this work improves understanding of the predictors and timing of wetland FCH4 that can inform future studies and models, and help constrain wetland CH 4 emissions.",Study of methane fluxes and their environmental predictors in freshwater wetland ecosystems.,Global Change Biology,2021,27,15,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15661,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,122,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

We used cavity ring-down spectroscopy and automated chambers in a drained agricultural peatland to measure over 70,000 individual N2 O, methane (CH4 ), and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) fluxes over 3 years. Our results showed that N2 O fluxes were high, contributing 26% (annual range: 16%-35%) of annual CO2 e emissions. Total N2 O fluxes averaged 26 ± 0.5 kg N2 O-N ha-1 y-1 and exhibited significant inter- and intra-annual variability with a maximum annual flux of 42 ± 1.8 kg N2 O-N ha-1 y-1 . Hot moments of N2 O and CH4 emissions represented 1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.3 ± 0.2% of measurements, respectively, but contributed to 45 ± 1% of mean annual N2 O fluxes and to 140 ± 9% of mean annual CH4 fluxes. Soil moisture, soil temperature, and bulk soil oxygen (O2 ) concentrations were strongly correlated with soil N2 O and CH4 emissions; soil nitrate ( NO3- ) concentrations were also significantly correlated with soil N2 O emissions. These results suggest that IPCC benchmarks underestimate N2 O emissions from these high emitting agricultural peatlands by up to 70%.

While some methods on ET partitioning have been developed, their underlying assumptions make them difficult to apply more generally, especially in sites with large contributions of E. Here, we report a novel ET partitioning method using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in combination with a range of environmental input variables to predict daytime E from nighttime ET measurements. The study uses eddy covariance data from four restored wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA, as well as leaf-level T data for validation. The four wetlands vary in their vegetation make-up and structure, representing a range of ET conditions. The ANNs were built with increasing complexity by adding the input variable that resulted in the next highest average value of model testing R2 across all sites. The order of variable inclusion (and importance) was: VPD > gap-filled sensible heat flux (H_gf) > air temperature (Tair ) > friction velocity (u∗ ) > other variables. The model using VPD, H_gf, Tair , and u∗ showed the best performance during validation with independent data and had a mean testing R2 value of 0.853 (averaged across all sites, range from 0.728 to 0.910). In comparison to other methods, our ANN method generated T/ET partitioning results which were more consistent with CO2 exchange data especially for more heterogeneous sites with large E contributions.

The eddy covariance method provides robust measurements of net ecosystem exchange of CH4 , but interpreting its spatiotemporal variations is challenging due to the co-occurrence of CH4 production, oxidation, and transport dynamics. Here, we estimate these three processes using a data-model fusion approach across 25 wetlands in temperate, boreal, and Arctic regions. Our data-constrained model-iPEACE-reasonably reproduced CH4 emissions at 19 of the 25 sites with normalized root mean square error of 0.59, correlation coefficient of 0.82, and normalized standard deviation of 0.87. Among the three processes, CH4 production appeared to be the most important process, followed by oxidation in explaining inter-site variations in CH4 emissions. Based on a sensitivity analysis, CH4 emissions were generally more sensitive to decreased water table than to increased gross primary productivity or soil temperature. For periods with leaf area index (LAI) of ≥20% of its annual peak, plant-mediated transport appeared to be the major pathway for CH4 transport. Contributions from ebullition and diffusion were relatively high during low LAI (<20%) periods. The lag time between CH4 production and CH4 emissions tended to be short in fen sites (3 ± 2 days) and long in bog sites (13 ± 10 days). Based on a principal component analysis, we found that parameters for CH4 production, plant-mediated transport, and diffusion through water explained 77% of the variance in the parameters across the 19 sites, highlighting the importance of these parameters for predicting wetland CH4 emissions across biomes. These processes and associated parameters for CH4 emissions among and within the wetlands provide useful insights for interpreting observed net CH4 fluxes, estimating sensitivities to biophysical variables, and modeling global CH4 fluxes.","Studies wetland methane emissions and their processes, crucial for understanding global climate patterns.",Global Change Biology,2023,29,8,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16594,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/gcb.16594,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,publisher-specific-oa,30,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Some of the most important factors in determining the performance of a MAR project include site selection, subsurface hydrogeologic characteristics and associated properties of the storage zone. Costs for invasive subsurface investigations to address these factors have slowly increased over the past two decades, with drilling costs increasing dramatically by as much as 30% or more since COVID‐19 hit, a result of supply chain issues, steel prices, and manpower challenges. This paper provides a high‐level review of major geophysical methods that have become more mainstream over the past decade or two to supplement invasive subsurface investigations and are very cost effective when compared to drilling boreholes and installing wells, which provide only point data. The more commonly used surface geophysical methods include ground‐based and airborne time‐domain electromagnetic methods (TEM), electrical resistivity, and seismic reflection. Airborne TEM methods (AEM) collect data very quickly, avoiding ground‐based access constraints, and land‐based methods are especially efficient using towed arrays. Electrical resistivity measurements provide resolution comparable to TEM but require more time than towed methods. Seismic reflection surveys are more expensive than other methods but typically have a much greater depth of penetration and can provide high resolution information on aquifer geometry, geology, and faults.

ARCHI imputes missing data in “target” records by linear regression using more complete “reference” records as predictors. Automated imputation is implemented using a novel, iterative algorithm that allows each site to be considered a target or reference for regression, growing the pool of complete references with each imputed record until viable gap‐filling ceases. Users can limit artifacts from spurious correlations by specifying model‐acceptance criteria and applying geospatial, correlation, and group‐based filters to control reference selection. ARCHI provides additional functions for visualizing results, clustering records with similar correlation structures, evaluating holdout data, and interactive parameterization with an accessible and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This methods brief provides an overview of the ARCHI package, modeling guidelines, and benchmarking on two regional groundwater‐level datasets from the Central Valley, CA and Long Island, NY.

However, there are uncertainties in the estimation of hydrologic conditions that contribute to extreme floods. In particular, this is the case in snow‐dominated regions, as surface air temperature and wind speed are understood to have a substantial effect on the magnitude of a flood during a storm event. Motivated by the development of a new approach to investigate and estimate reliable PMF values and in an attempt to resolve the uncertainty issues, this study introduces a physically based modeling approach. For the case study, seven watersheds located in the Sierra‐Nevada mountain range of California, including Cosumnes, Mokelumne, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, Upper San Joaquin, and Upper Kings were selected. The hydroclimate model was first implemented over the physical boundaries of the study region, and then utilized to simulate possible maximum flood conditions with input from 10 extreme precipitation scenarios. The study results provide evidence of a nonlinear atmospheric–hydrologic system; the extreme 72‐h basin‐averaged precipitation depth was found not to be linearly proportional to 72‐h flow volume equivalent depth. It can also be concluded that a large precipitation depth may not be the sole reason for a large flood event. Temperature and other atmospheric variables also contribute significantly to the production of snowfall and liquid water available for runoff, and to the resulting hydrologic response, such as the flood peak discharge and volume.",Focuses on developing an atmospheric-hydrologic modeling system for probable maximum flood estimation.,Journal of Flood Risk Management,2022,15,3,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.12809,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jfr3.12809,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by-nc-nd,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Michael L.

Despite intense genetic management, fitness differences between wild and cultured fish have been observed at the FCCL. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of hatchery domestication, we used whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing to quantify epigenetic differences between wild and hatchery‐origin delta smelt. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified from 104 individuals by comparing the methylation patterns in different generations of hatchery fish (G1, G2, G3) with their wild parents (G0). We discovered a total of 132 significant DMRs ( p &lt; .05) between G0 and G1, 132 significant DMRs between G0 and G2, and 201 significant DMRs between G0 and G3. Our results demonstrate substantial differences in methylation patterns emerged between the wild and hatchery‐reared fish in the early generations in the hatchery, with a higher proportion of hypermethylated DMRs in hatchery‐reared fish. The rearing environment was found to be a stronger predictor of individual clustering based on methylation patterns than family, sex or generation. Our study indicates a reinforcement of the epigenetic status with successive generations in the hatchery environment, as evidenced by an increase in methylation in hypermethylated DMRs and a decrease in methylation in hypomethylated DMRs over time. Lastly, our results demonstrated heterogeneity in inherited methylation pattern in families across generations.

Wild waterfowl and the natural wetlands they use are known AIV reservoirs, with birds capable of virus transmission to domestic poultry populations. While infection risk models have linked migration routes and AIV outbreaks, there is a limited understanding of wild waterfowl presence on commercial livestock facilities, and movement patterns linked to natural wetlands. We documented 11 wild waterfowl (three Anatidae species) in or near eight commercial livestock facilities in Washington and California with GPS telemetry data. Wild ducks used dairy and beef cattle feed lots and facility retention ponds during both day and night suggesting use for roosting and foraging. Two individuals (single locations) were observed inside poultry facility boundaries while using nearby wetlands. Ducks demonstrated high site fidelity, returning to the same areas of habitats (at livestock facilities and nearby wetlands), across months or years, showed strong connectivity with surrounding wetlands, and arrived from wetlands up to 1251 km away in the week prior. Telemetry data provides substantial advantages over observational data, allowing assessment of individual movement behaviour and wetland connectivity that has significant implications for outbreak management. Telemetry improves our understanding of risk factors for waterfowl-livestock virus transmission and helps identify factors associated with coincident space use at the wild waterfowl-domestic livestock interface. Our research suggests that even relatively small or isolated natural and artificial water or food sources in/near facilities increases the likelihood of attracting waterfowl, which has important consequences for managers attempting to minimize or prevent AIV outbreaks. Use and interpretation of telemetry data, especially in near-real-time, could provide key information for reducing virus transmission risk between waterfowl and livestock, improving protective barriers between wild and domestic species, and abating outbreaks.",Study of wild waterfowl behavior and movement patterns related to avian influenza virus spread.,Transboundary and Emerging Diseases,2022,69,5,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14445,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,39,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Salmonid eggs and embryos can assimilate exogenous thiamine, and evidence suggests that microbial communities in benthic environments can produce substantial amounts of thiamine. We therefore hypothesize that natural dissolved pools of thiamine exist in the surface water and hyporheic zones of riverine habitats where salmonids with TDC migrate, spawn, and begin their lives. To examine the relationship between dissolved thiamine-related compounds (dTRCs) and their microbial source, we determined the concentrations of these metabolites and the compositions of microbial communities in surface and hyporheic waters of the Sacramento River, California and its tributaries. Here we determine that all dTRCs are present in femto-picomolar concentrations in a range of critically important salmon spawning habitats. We observed that thiamine concentrations in the Sacramento River system are orders of magnitude lower than those of marine waters, indicating substantial differences in thiamine cycling between these two environments. Our data suggest that the hyporheic zone is likely the source of thiamine to the overlying surface water. Temporal variations in dTRC concentrations were observed where the highest concentrations existed when Chinook salmon were actively spawning. Significant correlations were seen between the richness of microbial taxa and dTRC concentrations, particularly in the hyporheic zone, which would influence the conditions where embryonic salmon incubate. Together, these results indicate a connection between microbial communities in freshwater habitats and the availability of thiamine to spawning TDC-impacted California Central Valley Chinook salmon.IMPORTANCEPacific salmon are keystone species with considerable economic importance and immeasurable cultural significance to Pacific Northwest indigenous peoples. Thiamine deficiency complex has recently been diagnosed as an emerging threat to the health and stability of multiple populations of salmonids ranging from California to Alaska.

Until recently, the distribution of active faults in and around the Salton Sea and their displacement histories were largely unknown. Subbottom CHIRP (compressed high-intensity radar pulse) surveys in the Salton Sea are used to develop a seismic facies model for ancient Lake Cahuilla deposits, a detailed map of submerged active faults, and reconstructed fault displacement histories during the late Holocene. We observe as many as fourteen Lake Cahuilla sequences in the Salton Sea (last ~3 k.y.) and develop a chronostratigraphic framework for the last six sequences (last ~1200 yr) by integrating CHIRP data and cone penetrometer logs with radiocarbon-dated stratigraphy at an onshore paleoseismic site. The Salton Sea contains northern and southern subbasins that appear to be separated by a tectonic hinge zone, and a subsidence signal across hinge-zone faults of 6–9 mm/yr (since ca. A.D. 940) increases toward the south to &amp;gt;15 mm/yr. The faults mapped to the south of the hinge zone appear to accommodate transtension within the San Andreas–Imperial fault stepover. We identify 8–15 distinct growth events across hinge-zone faults, meaning growth occurred at least once every 100 yr since Lake Cahuilla sedimentation began. Several faults offset the top of the most recent Lake Cahuilla highstand deposits, and at least two faults have offset the Salton Sea flood deposits. Active faults and folds were also mapped to a limited extent within the northern subbasin and display growth, but their kinematics and rupture histories require further study.

Here, we use genome-wide data to evaluate population structure of longfin smelt across a broad latitudinal scale across estuaries ranging from the SFE to Yakutat Bay and Lake Washington, and fine scale within the Fraser River and the SFE. Results indicate high genetic structure between major estuaries, fine-scale structure within the Fraser River, and low levels of structure within the SFE. Genetic structure was more pronounced between northern estuaries whereas southern estuaries showed shared ancestry and ongoing gene flow, most notably unidirectional northward migration out of the SFE. Furthermore, we detected signatures of local adaptation within the Fraser River and the Skeena River estuaries. Taken together, our results identify broad patterns of genetic diversity in longfin smelt shaped by co-ancestry, unidirectional migration and local adaptation.

Longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys is an imperiled migratory fish that is believed to spawn and rear in habitats of varying salinities; however, optimal conditions for each stage remain unknown. Here, we examined the effects of variation in salinity on egg fertilization, hatch success, and larval growth and survival. Eggs that were fertilized in freshwater (0.4 ppt) exhibited a significantly higher fertilization rate (81%) than those fertilized in brackish water (62% at 5 ppt), with no detectible effects of fish origin or female size. In contrast to fertilization rates, once the eggs were fertilized, their hatching rates were not affected by the fertilization salinity, incubation salinity, nor their interaction; however, hatching success and larval survival both increased with increasing maternal body mass. Larval growth rate appeared to be independent of salinity and maternal size. Taken together, the results indicate that fertilization is possible at a range of salinities, but optimal at lower salinities for longfin smelt; however, embryos and larvae can perform well across a range of salinities. Furthermore, results indicated that larger mothers produced high-quality offspring, a finding that supports the “bigger is better” paradigm in fisheries science and management. These results likely explain, in part, the spawning and rearing behaviors of wild longfin smelt and suggest that the conservation culture program would likely be optimized by utilizing freshwater fertilization and larger females as broodstock.",Examines fish reproduction and larval performance to inform fisheries management and conservation.,Aquaculture Research,2023,2023,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9984382,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/are/2023/9984382.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

As an experimental system, AQPI leverages more than a decade of research, innovation, and implementation of a statewide, state-of-the-art network of observations, and development of the next generation of weather and coastal forecast models. AQPI was developed as a prototype in response to requests from the water management community for improved information on precipitation, riverine, and coastal conditions to inform their decision-making processes. Observation of precipitation in the complex Bay Area landscape of California’s coastal mountain ranges is known to be a challenging problem. But, with new advanced radar network techniques, AQPI is helping fill an important observational gap for this highly populated and vulnerable metropolitan area. The prototype AQPI system consists of improved weather radar data for precipitation estimation; additional surface measurements of precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture; and a suite of integrated forecast modeling systems to improve situational awareness about current and future water conditions from sky to sea. Together these tools will help improve emergency preparedness and public response to prevent loss of life and destruction of property during extreme storms accompanied by heavy precipitation and high coastal water levels—especially high-moisture laden atmospheric rivers.

October hindcasts by the coupled dynamical models typically show a correlation skill of about 0.3 for CA winter (November–March) precipitation. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the underlying processes that limit seasonal prediction skill for CA winter precipitation. It is found that only about 25% of interannual variability of CA winter precipitation can be attributed to influences by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Instead, the year-to-year CA winter precipitation variability is primarily due to circulation anomalies independent from ENSO, featuring a circulation center over the west coast United States as a portion of a short Rossby wave train pattern over the North Pacific. Analyses suggest that dynamical models show nearly no skill in predicting these ENSO-independent circulation anomalies, thus leading to limited predictive skill for CA winter precipitation. Low predictability of these ENSO-independent circulation anomalies is further demonstrated by a large ensemble of atmospheric-only climate model simulations. While low predictability of the ENSO-independent circulation anomalies could be due to chaotic internal atmospheric processes over the mid- to high latitudes, possible underexploited predictability sources for CA precipitation in models are also discussed. This study pinpoints an urgent need for improved understanding of the formation mechanisms of ENSO-independent circulation anomalies over the U.S. West Coast for a breakthrough in seasonal prediction of CA winter precipitation.",Analyzes challenges in seasonal prediction of winter precipitation and climate variability.,Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,2022,103,12,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-21-0252.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/103/12/BAMS-D-21-0252.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,14,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

With La Niña ruling the tropical Pacific, the record-setting, disruptive snowfall during Christmas week raised questions about its origin, especially as the seasonal outlook was for below-normal precipitation. We show that Pacific–North American (PNA) teleconnection—a well-documented subseasonal variability pattern during winter—reigned over the region in its negative phase; it was the strongest 7-day PNA episode in December in more than 50 years. It led to robust northwesterly onshore flow, whose interaction with the Coastal, Cascade, and Sierra ranges led to blockbuster snowfall and precipitation. Note that one seldom encounters circulation anomalies consisting of just one winter teleconnection pattern.

However, experimental subseasonal forecasts skillfully captured the regime shift from dry to wet conditions in late December 2022 at 2–3 week lead time. During this time, an active MJO shift from phases 4 and 5 to 6 and 7 occurred, which historically tilts the odds toward increased AR activity over California.

This study chronicles the water year, highlighting the challenges state water managers faced as California shifted from extreme drought to elevated flood risks due to an unprecedented “weather whiplash” and a subsequent record-setting snowpack. By analyzing precipitation and temperature data from 2002 to 2023, the research highlights the anomalous nature of these variables in California during this period. It focuses on the impacts of atmospheric rivers (ARs) due to their proven influence on seasonal precipitation patterns and intensities, examining their hydrologic impacts—specifically, snow water equivalent (SWE) in Sierra Nevada and reservoir storage—compared to other high precipitation years in California to gauge the effects of this atypical weather on water resources. The study reveals that Southern California’s wintertime precipitation in 2022–23 was the highest in over two decades. Precipitation was closely linked to the occurrence of 11 moderate to strong ARs, which alleviated the state’s drought conditions—94% of California was drought free by the end of the water year. Additionally, the mean maximum temperature was below the long-term average during spring and summer, decelerating snowpack melt and mitigating flood potential. Notably, 2022–23 saw the most significant increases in SWE and reservoir storage among the years analyzed. This research delves into the complex interplay between AR-driven precipitation, temperature, and snowpack, providing valuable insights into the precarious dynamics of California’s regional hydrology with a real-world example.","Analyzes anomalous weather and atmospheric rivers' impacts on California's water resources, snowpack, and regional hydrology.",Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,2025,106,5,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/bams-d-23-0336.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Corbett,California Geological Survey; University of California San Diego; United States Geological Survey; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,,atmospheric sciences,meteorology,0.95,"Shallow landslides are often triggered during rainfall events, which can increase subsurface soil water pressure and destabilize hillslopes. The likelihood of regional shallow landslide initiation is often assessed through a comparison of rainfall intensity and duration to pre-established thresholds. While informative for landslide warning, this exclusive focus on rainfall exceeding thresholds does not consider the meteorological conditions producing the rainfall. Here, we ask the question, are there common meteorological characteristics that lead to landslide-triggering precipitation? We develop a catalog of 18 post-1995 widespread, impactful shallow landslide events occurring within 13 storms across California, USA, where initiation time could be constrained to a ≤6-h window. We examine storm characteristics during the landslide initiation window using atmospheric reanalysis products, radar observations, and quantitative precipitation estimates. We find that, while there are some common atmospheric characteristics across landslide events, they can occur under a range of atmospheric conditions. For example, all Northern California landslide events assessed are associated with moderate to strong atmospheric rivers (ARs), while Southern California landslides feature non-AR to strong AR conditions. The storm events evaluated herein share many characteristics of hydrologically important storms in California that did not necessarily result in landslides; thus, atmospheric characteristics alone may not be sufficient to determine whether landslides will occur. However, documenting the characteristics of landslide-triggering storms defines the conditions under which landslides tend to occur, provides analog events that can be useful in forecast applications, helps define future research directions relating to atmospheric conditions and landslides, and supports interdisciplinary research efforts. Significance Statement Rainfall-triggered landslides pose a threat to communities situated in and around California’s steep terrain. Thresholds related to measured antecedent rainfall accumulation and anticipated rainfall intensity over various durations are typically used for predicting landslide occurrence. Here, we assess various atmospheric characteristics of 18 storms that triggered landslides to determine whether there are common characteristics that could provide insight into landslide occurrence beyond precipitation information. Our results indicate while there are some common characteristics across landslide events, the events can occur under a range of conditions. This finding and the documentation of these events are useful for communicating weather forecasts and potential hazards, help build an interdisciplinary understanding of landslide-triggering precipitation, and highlight future research needs.",Examines atmospheric conditions and meteorological characteristics of landslide-triggering storms.,Earth Interactions,2024,28,1,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/ei-d-24-0003.1,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Martin Ralph,University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,,atmospheric sciences,meteorology,0.95,"Atmospheric rivers (AR) are narrow bands of strong horizontal transport of water vapor in the midlatitudes that can cause extreme precipitation, which contributes to beneficial water supply and sometimes flooding. The precipitation productivity of an AR is affected by microphysical processes, including the influence of aerosols. Earlier case studies have shown that some ARs over the North Pacific Ocean contain dust from Africa and Asia that can strongly influence precipitation by acting as ice nuclei. This paper explores how commonly dust and ARs occur together, or in close proximity. A “dust score” is introduced to characterize the dustiness of the environment associated with ARs by using satellite-based observations. This method is applied to days on which one or more ARs made landfall along the west coast of the United States between 2001 and 2018. The dust score is used to describe the seasonality and year-to-year variability of dusty-environment ARs. Dusty ARs occur primarily in the early spring (March–April), and dust is preferentially found within the warm sector of AR-associated extratropical cyclones and is also enhanced in the cold sector. Year-to-year variability in dust score is dependent more on year-to-year variability in dust than on the frequency of AR days. This year-to-year variability is also strongly related to correlations between the frequency of ARs and the dustiness of the northeastern Pacific, motivating additional investigation into potential dynamical association between dust and ARs.","Analyzes atmospheric rivers, dust interaction, and their impact on precipitation and weather patterns.",Journal of Climate,2020,33,22,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0059.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,5,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This study reveals the pronounced month-to-month evolution of both the ENSO forcing signal and internal variability. Internal variance in upper-level geopotential height decreases (∼ 10%) over the North Pacific during El Niño as the westerly jet extends eastward, allowing forced signals to account for a greater fraction of the total variability, and leading to increased potential predictability. We identify February and March of El Niño years as the most predictable months using a signal-to-noise analysis. In contrast, December, a month typically included in teleconnection studies, shows little-to-no potential predictability. We show that the seasonal evolution of SST forcing and variability leads to significant signal-to-noise relationships that can be directly linked to both upper-level and surface variable predictability for a given month. The stark changes in forced response, internal variability, and thus signal-to-noise across an ENSO season indicate that subseasonal fields should be used to diagnose potential predictability over North America associated with ENSO teleconnections.

Monthly, basin-averaged soil moisture, snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation, and the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are selected as potential predictors. Pacific SST Predictors (PSPs) are derived from a dipole pattern over the Pacific (30°S–65°N) that is correlated with the lagging streamflow. For both models, the correlation between the hindcasted and observed streamflow exceeds 0.60 for lead times less than four months using soil moisture, SWE, and precipitation as predictors. This correlation is higher than that of an autoregression model (correlation ~0.50). Since these land-surface and atmospheric variables have no statistically significant correlations with the streamflow, PSPs are then incorporated into the models. The two models have a correlation of ~0.50 using PSPs alone for lead times from six to nine months, and such skills are probably associated with stronger correlation between SST and streamflow in recent decades. The similar prediction skills between the two models suggest a largely linear system between SST and streamflow. Four predictors together can further improve short-lead prediction skills (correlation ~0.80). Therefore, our results confirm the advantage of the Pacific SST information in predicting the UCRB streamflow with a long lead time, and can provide useful climate information for water supply planning and decisions.","Predicting seasonal streamflow using large-scale climate drivers like sea surface temperature, studying effects of climate variability.",Journal of Climate,2021,,,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-20-0824.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/clim/34/16/JCLI-D-20-0824.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,11,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Despite the outsized societal impacts that often stem from AR families, the large-scale environments and mechanisms associated with these compound events remain poorly understood. In this work, a new reanalysis-based 39-yr catalog of 248 AR family events affecting California between 1981 and 2019 is introduced. Nearly all (94%) of the interannual variability in AR frequency is driven by AR family versus single events. Using k -means clustering on the 500-hPa geopotential height field, six distinct clusters of large-scale patterns associated with AR families are identified. Two clusters are of particular interest due to their strong relationship with phases of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One of these clusters is characterized by a strong ridge in the Bering Sea and Rossby wave propagation, most frequently occurs during La Niña and neutral ENSO years, and is associated with the highest cluster-average precipitation across California. The other cluster, characterized by a zonal elongation of lower geopotential heights across the Pacific basin and an extended North Pacific jet, most frequently occurs during El Niño years and is associated with lower cluster-average precipitation across California but with a longer duration. In contrast, single AR events do not show obvious clustering of spatial patterns. This difference suggests that the potential predictability of AR families may be enhanced relative to single AR events, especially on subseasonal to seasonal time scales.","Studies large-scale atmospheric patterns, climate variability (ENSO), and their effects on precipitation extremes over decades.",Journal of Climate,2021,35,5,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-21-0168.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,36,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The most robust and significant change is an eastward extension (∼4° eastward for the multimodel mean) of MJO teleconnections in the North Pacific. Other projected changes in MJO teleconnections include a northward extension, more consistent patterns between different MJO events, stronger amplitude, and shorter persistence; however, these changes are more uncertain and less significant with a large intra- and intermodel spread. Mechanisms of the eastward teleconnection extension are investigated by comparing impacts of the future MJO and basic state changes on the anomalous Rossby wave source (RWS) and teleconnection pathways with a linear baroclinic model (LBM). The eastward extended jet in the future plays a more important role than the eastward-extended MJO in influencing the east–west position of MJO teleconnections. It leads to more eastward teleconnection propagation along the jet due to the eastward extension of turning latitudes before they propagate into North America. MJO teleconnections thus are positioned 2.9° more eastward in the North Pacific in the LBM. The eastward extended MJO, on the other hand, helps to generate a more eastward-extended RWS. However, negligible change is found in the east–west position of MJO teleconnections (only 0.3° more eastward in the LBM) excited from this RWS without the jet impacts.

We found that the cloud base definition in the cumulus parameterization was the dominant factor determining the spread of the biases among models and those defining cloud base at the lifting condensation level (LCL) performed the best. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we developed a physically based analytical bias model (ABM) to capture the key feedback processes of land–atmosphere coupling. The ABM has significant explanatory power, capturing 80% variance of temperature and precipitation biases among all models. Our ABM analysis via counterfactual experiments indicated that the biases are attributed mostly by surface downwelling longwave radiation errors and second by surface net shortwave radiation errors, with the former 2–5 times larger. The effective radiative forcing from these two errors as weighted by their relative contributions induces runaway temperature and precipitation feedbacks, which collaborate to cause CUS summer warm and dry biases. The LCL cumulus reduces the biases through two key mechanisms: it produces more clouds and less precipitable water, which reduce radiative energy input for both surface heating and evapotranspiration to cause a cooler and wetter soil; it produces more rainfall and wetter soil conditions, which suppress the positive evapotranspiration–precipitation feedback to damp the warm and dry bias coupling.

This record-shattering event saw numerous monthly temperature records being broken including a new all-time temperature record of −9.4°C on 18 March at Concordia Station despite March typically being a transition month to the Antarctic coreless winter. The driver for these temperature extremes was an intense atmospheric river advecting subtropical/midlatitude heat and moisture deep into the Antarctic interior. The scope of the temperature records spurred a large, diverse collaborative effort to study the heat wave’s meteorological drivers, impacts, and historical climate context. Here we focus on describing those temperature records along with the intricate meteorological drivers that led to the most intense atmospheric river observed over East Antarctica. These efforts describe the Rossby wave activity forced from intense tropical convection over the Indian Ocean. This led to an atmospheric river and warm conveyor belt intensification near the coastline, which reinforced atmospheric blocking deep into East Antarctica. The resulting moisture flux and upper-level warm-air advection eroded the typical surface temperature inversions over the ice sheet. At the peak of the heat wave, an area of 3.3 million km 2 in East Antarctica exceeded previous March monthly temperature records. Despite a temperature anomaly return time of about 100 years, a closer recurrence of such an event is possible under future climate projections.

An analysis of the surface energy budget indicated that widespread downward longwave radiation anomalies caused by large cloud-liquid water contents along with some scattered solar radiation produced intense surface warming. Isotope measurements of the moisture were highly elevated, likely imprinting a strong signal for past climate reconstructions. The AR event attenuated cosmic ray measurements at Concordia, something previously never observed. Last, an extratropical cyclone west of the AR landfall likely triggered the final collapse of the critically unstable Conger Ice Shelf while further reducing an already record low sea ice extent. Significance Statement Using our diverse collective expertise, we explored the impacts from the March 2022 heat wave and atmospheric river across East Antarctica. One key takeaway is that the Antarctic cryosphere is highly sensitive to meteorological extremes originating from the midlatitudes and subtropics. Despite the large positive temperature anomalies driven from strong downward longwave radiation, this event led to huge amounts of snowfall across the Antarctic interior desert. The isotopes in this snow of warm airmass origin will likely be detectable in future ice cores and potentially distort past climate reconstructions. Even measurements of space activity were affected. Also, the swells generated from this storm helped to trigger the final collapse of an already critically unstable Conger Ice Shelf while further degrading sea ice coverage.","Analysis of an extreme Antarctic heat wave, its meteorological drivers, and impacts on the ice sheet and cryosphere.",Journal of Climate,2023,37,3,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-23-0176.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/view/journals/clim/37/3/JCLI-D-23-0176.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,35,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In the Sierra Nevada, approximately half of cool-season precipitation is derived from a small proportion of storms classified as atmospheric rivers (ARs). The frequency and intensity of ARs are highly variable from year to year and unreliable climate teleconnections limit forecasting. However, previous research provides intriguing evidence of cycles with biennial (2.2 years) and decadal (10–20 years) periodicities in Sierra Nevada cool-season precipitation, suggesting it is not purely stochastic. To identify the source of this cyclicity, we decompose daily precipitation records (1949–2022) into contributions from ARs versus non-ARs, as well as into variations in frequency and intensity. We find that the biennial and decadal spectral peaks in Sierra Nevada precipitation totals are entirely due to precipitation delivered by ARs, and primarily due to variations in the frequency of days with AR precipitation. While total non-AR precipitation correlates with sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric pressure patterns associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, AR precipitation shows no consistent remote teleconnections at any periodicity. Supporting this finding, atmospheric simulations forced by observed SSTs do not reproduce the biennial or decadal precipitation variations identified in observations. These results, combined with the lack of long-term stable cycles in previously published tree-ring reconstructions, suggest that the observed biennial and decadal quasi-cyclicity in Sierra Nevada precipitation is unreliable as a forecasting tool. Significance Statement In California’s Sierra Nevada, where most of the state’s above-ground water resources originate, cool-season precipitation totals exhibited year-to-year and decadal cyclicity over the past century. Long-range forecasts are notoriously unskillful in this region, so nonrandom cycles would be intriguing to water managers challenged to simultaneously minimize flood and drought risk. Over 1949–2022, precipitation cycles were driven by variations in the number of atmospheric river (AR) storms per year even though ARs account for just half of total precipitation. These findings bring us a step closer to understanding the causes of precipitation cyclicity, but we find no evidence that the cycles were underpinned by larger-scale ocean–atmosphere circulations so we caution against relying on continued cycles into the future.","Analyzes long-term precipitation cyclicity, its atmospheric drivers (atmospheric rivers), and climate teleconnections.",Journal of Climate,2024,37,5,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-23-0421.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/view/journals/clim/37/5/JCLI-D-23-0421.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Cluster analyses identify three primary wave trains associated with SWUS precipitation: a meridional El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)–type wave train, an arching Pacific–North American (PNA)–type wave train, and a circumglobal zonal wave train. Compared to reanalysis, the models overrepresent the arching pattern, underrepresent the zonal pattern, and produce mixed results for the meridional pattern. The arching pattern overrepresentation is linked to model mean flow biases in the midlatitude–subpolar North Pacific, which cause a westward retraction of the region of forbidden linear Rossby wave propagation. The zonal pattern underrepresentation is linked to westerly biases in the subtropical jet, which cause a westward retraction of the waveguide in the midlatitude eastern North Pacific and divert wave trains southward. These results are confirmed using linear, barotropic ray-tracing analysis. In addition to mean state biases, the models also contain errors in their representation of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). Tropical convection anomalies associated with the MJO are too weak and incoherent at lead times greater than 2 weeks when compared to reanalysis. Additionally, there is a strong SWUS precipitation signal as far out as 5 weeks after a strong MJO in reanalysis, associated with its persistent eastward propagation, but this signal is absent in the models.

We identify key model biases that degrade the models’ capability to predict SWUS precipitation. The subtropical jet in the Pacific sector is generally too zonal and elongated. This is reflected in the models’ North Pacific ENSO teleconnections that are generally too weak with exaggerated northwest-southeast tilt, compared to observations. Also, the models are too dependent on tropical, El Niño-like, wave train anomalies for producing high seasonal SWUS precipitation, when in observations there is a larger influence of zonal Rossby wave trains such as the one observed in 2016/17. Overall, this is consistent with biases in the basic flow inducing errors in the propagation of zonal wave trains in the North Pacific, which affects SWUS precipitation downstream. Although higher skill may be gained from reducing mean flow biases in the models, a case study of the 2016/17 winter illustrates the great challenge behind skillful seasonal prediction of SWUS precipitation. Unsurprisingly, the almost record-breaking precipitation observed that year in the absence of ENSO is not predicted in the hindcasts, and model perturbation experiments suggest that even a perfect prediction of tropical sea surface temperature and tropical atmospheric variability would not have sufficed to produce a reasonable seasonal precipitation prediction. On a more positive note, our perturbation experiments suggest a potential role for Arctic variability that supports findings from prior studies and suggests re-examining high-latitude drivers of SWUS precipitation.",Analyzes model biases in seasonal climate prediction for Southwest US precipitation and teleconnections.,Journal of Climate,2024,38,,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-24-0287.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Antecedent soil moisture (ASM) conditions can have a large impact on flood responses, especially if prestorm precipitation decreases. Taken together with increased antecedent evaporative demand due to warming, this would result in reduced soil moisture at the onset of extreme precipitation events. We examine the impact of ASM on AR-related floods in a warming climate in three basins that form a transect along the U.S. Pacific Coast: the Chehalis River basin in Washington, the Russian River basin in Northern California, and the Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. We ran the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) over the three river basins using forcings downscaled from 10 global climate models (GCMs). We examined the dynamic role of ASM by comparing the changes in the largest 50, 100, and 150 extreme events in two periods, 1951–2000 and 2050–99. In the Chehalis basin, the projected fraction of AR-related extreme discharge events slightly decreases. In the Russian basin, this fraction increases, however, and more substantially so in the Santa Margarita basin. This is due to increases in AR-related extreme precipitation events, as well as the fact that the relationship of extreme precipitation to extreme discharge is strengthened by projected increases in year-to-year volatility of annual precipitation in California, which increases the likelihood of concurrent occurrence of large storms and wet ASM conditions.",Analyzes the role of atmospheric rivers and soil moisture in flood generation under a warming climate.,Journal of Hydrometeorology,2020,21,8,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-19-0242.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/hydr/21/8/jhmD190242.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,36,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

With data from 17 spatially distributed clusters (178 nodes) from two networks, in the American and Feather River basins of California’s Sierra Nevada, we analyzed transition elevation during 76 storm events in 2014–18. A T wet threshold of 0.5°C best matched the transition elevation defined by snow depth. Transition elevations using T wet in upper elevations of the basins generally agreed with atmospheric snow level from radars located at lower elevations, while radar snow level was ~100 m higher due to snow-level lowering on windward mountainsides during orographic lifting. Diurnal patterns of the difference between transition elevation and radar snow level were observed in the American basin, related to diurnal ground-temperature variations. However, these patterns were not found in the Feather basin due to complex terrain and higher uncertainties in transition-elevation estimates. The American basin tends to exhibit 100-m-higher transition elevations than does the Feather basin, consistent with the Feather basin being about 1° latitude farther north. Transition elevation averaged 155 m higher in intense atmospheric river events than in other events; meanwhile, snow-level lowering was enhanced with a 90-m-larger difference between radar snow level and transition elevation.

Column-integrated moisture flux convergence is estimated from eight dropsonde profiles, and surface rain rate is estimated from tail Doppler radar reflectivity measurements. Dynamical convergence of water vapor (2.20 ± 0.12 mm h −1 ) nearly balances estimated precipitation (2.47 ± 0.41 mm h −1 ), but surface evaporation (0.0 ± 0.05 mm h −1 ) is negligible. Advection of drier air into the budget region (−1.50 ± 0.21 mm h −1 ) causes IWV tendency from the sum of all terms to be negative (−1.66 ± 0.45 mm h −1 ). An independent estimate of IWV tendency obtained from the difference between IWV measured by dropsonde and retrieved by satellite 3 h earlier is less negative (−0.52 ± 0.24 mm h −1 ), suggesting the presence of substantial temporal variability that is smoothed out when averaging over several hours. The calculation of budget terms for various combinations of dropsonde subsets indicates the presence of substantial spatial variability at ~50-km scales for precipitation, moisture flux convergence, and IWV tendency that is smoothed out when averaging over the full budget region. Across subregions, surface rain rate is linearly proportional to dynamical convergence of water vapor.

This study investigates this relationship among landfalling ARs, IVT, and watershed mean areal precipitation (MAP) for a 38-yr period over California.

Further investigation of the IVT magnitude and direction at coastal locations illustrated that accounting for water vapor transport direction increases the explained variance in annual MAP to an average of 45%, with highest values (∼65%) occurring in watersheds over Northern and coastal California. Similar investigation of the lower-tropospheric water vapor flux vector at 850 and 925 hPa revealed further increases in the explained variance in annual MAP to an average of &gt;50%.

Thus, reliable quantitative precipitation estimation with a rich spatiotemporal resolution is vital for water management and early warning systems of flooding and landslides over these regions. At the same time, high-quality near-real-time measurements of AR precipitation remain challenging due to the complex topographic features of land surface and meteorological conditions of the region: specifically, orographic features occlude radar measurements while infrared-based algorithms face challenges, differentiating between both cold brightband (BB) precipitation and the warmer nonbrightband (NBB) precipitation. It should be noted that the latter precipitation is characterized by greater orographic enhancement. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a recently developed near-real-time satellite precipitation algorithm: Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate-Now (PDIR-Now). This model is primarily dependent on infrared information from geostationary satellites as input; consequently, PDIR-Now has the advantage of short data latency, 15–60-min delay between observation to precipitation product delivery. The performance of PDIR-Now is analyzed with a focus on AR-related events for cases dominated by NBB and BB precipitation over the Russian River basin. In our investigations, we utilize S-band (3-GHz) precipitation profilers with Joss/Parsivel disdrometer measurements at the Middletown and Santa Rosa stations to classify BB and NBB precipitation events. In general, our analysis shows that PDIR-Now is more skillful in retrieving precipitation rates over both BB and NBB events across the topologically complex study area as compared to PERSIANN-Cloud Classification System (CCS). Also, we discuss the performance of well-known operational near-real-time precipitation products from 2017 to 2019. Conventional categorical and volumetric categorical indices, as well as continuous statistical metrics, are used to show the differences between various high-resolution precipitation products such as Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS).",Evaluates a near-real-time satellite precipitation algorithm for atmospheric river events and complex atmospheric conditions.,Journal of Hydrometeorology,2022,23,12,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-22-0066.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/hydr/23/12/JHM-D-22-0066.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This study provides observational evidence of MJO impacts on precipitation extreme intensity, frequency, and duration over the western United States. The results suggest a robust increase in precipitation extremes, especially in frequency, relative to climatological conditions over most of the western United States when the MJO is in its western Pacific phases during the extended boreal winter (October–March). Opposite changes are observed when the MJO is located over the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent. The above MJO influence is characterized by strong seasonality, with the increase in extreme frequency mainly found in late autumn/early winter (OND) over California and a weaker or opposite response found in late winter (JFM). Also, MJO impacts have stronger regional consistency and persist for a longer time in OND compared to JFM. The seasonality of MJO impacts largely originates from the different amplitudes and patterns of both the MJO and basic states that are weaker and located/retreated more northwestward in OND than in JFM. This leads to different responses in MJO teleconnections including moisture transport and AR activity that contribute to the different precipitation extreme changes. The strong seasonality of the relationship between the MJO and western U.S. extreme precipitation shown in this study has implications to the source of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions, which has a potential value to stakeholders including water resource managers.",Studies the impact of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on precipitation extremes and their subseasonal predictability.,Journal of Hydrometeorology,2022,24,1,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-22-0089.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/hydr/24/1/JHM-D-22-0089.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,27,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Rain-on-snow (ROS) events are a common cause of widespread flooding and are expected to increase in both frequency and magnitude with anthropogenic climate change in this region. ROS flood severity depends on terrestrial water input (TWI), the sum of rain and snowmelt that reaches the land surface. However, an incomplete understanding of the processes that control the flow and refreezing of liquid water in the snowpack limits flood prediction by operational and research models. We examine how antecedent snowpack conditions alter TWI during 71 ROS events between water years 1981 and 2019. Observations across a 500-m elevation gradient from the Independence Creek catchment were input into SNOWPACK, a one-dimensional, physically based snow model, initiated with the Richards equation and calibrated with collocated snow pillow observations. We compare observed “historical” and “scenario” ROS events, where we hold meteorologic conditions constant but vary snowpack conditions. Snowpack variables include cold content, snow density, liquid water content, and snow water equivalent. Results indicate that historical events with TWI &gt; rain are associated with the largest observed streamflows. A multiple linear regression analysis of scenario events suggests that TWI is sensitive to interactions between snow density and cold content, with denser (&gt;0.30 g cm −3 ) and colder (&lt;−0.3 MJ of cold content) snowpacks retaining &gt;50 mm of TWI. These results highlight the importance of hydraulic limitations in dense snowpacks and energy limitations in warm snowpacks for retaining liquid water that would otherwise be available as TWI for flooding. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to understand how the snowpack modulates quantities of water that reach the land surface during rain-on-snow (ROS) events. While the amount of near-term storm rainfall is reasonably predicted by meteorologists, major floods associated with ROS are more difficult to predict and are expected to increase in frequency. Our key findings are that liquid water inputs to the land surface vary with snowpack characteristics, and although many hydrologic models incorporate snowpack cold content and density to some degree, the complexity of ROS events justifies the need for additional observations to improve operational forecasting model results. Our findings suggest additional comparisons between existing forecasting models and those that physically represent the snowpack, as well as field-based observations of cold content and density and liquid water content, would be useful follow-up investigations.",Examines snowpack properties and dynamics during rain-on-snow events affecting flood hydrology.,Journal of Hydrometeorology,2023,24,10,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-22-0090.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,7,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The object-based perspective analyzes the characteristics of spatially independent and temporally coherent AR objects making landfall. The local perspective shows that the annual AR frequency of weak and strong ARs along the coast is highest in Oregon and Washington and lowest in Southern California. Strong ARs occur less frequently than weak ARs and have a more pronounced seasonal cycle. If those ARs with integrated water vapor transport (IVT) weaker than 250 kg m −1 s −1 are included, there is an enhanced seasonal cycle of AR frequency in Southern California and a seasonal cycle of AR intensity but not AR frequency in Alaska. The object-based analysis additionally indicates that strong ARs at lower latitudes are associated with stronger wind than weak ARs but similar moisture, whereas strong ARs at higher latitudes are associated with greater moisture than weak ARs but similar wind. For strong ARs, IVT at the core is largest for ARs in Oregon and Washington and smaller poleward and equatorward.

The West-WRF reforecast has a 9-km domain covering western North America and the eastern Pacific Ocean and a 3-km domain covering much of California.

Rainfall on the ocean can generate a buoyant layer of freshwater that impacts exchanges between the surface and the mixed layer. These “fresh lenses” are important for weather and climate because they may impact the ocean stratification at all time scales. Here we use in situ ocean data, collocated with AR events, and a one-dimensional configuration of a general circulation model, to investigate the impact of AR precipitation on surface ocean salinity in the California Current System (CCS) on seasonal and event-based time scales. We find that at coastal and onshore locations the CCS freshens through the rainy season due to AR events, and years with higher AR activity are associated with a stronger freshening signal. On shorter time scales, model simulations suggest that events characteristic of CCS ARs can produce salinity changes that are detectable by ocean instruments (≥0.01 psu). Here, the surface salinity change depends linearly on rain rate and inversely on wind speed. Higher wind speeds ( U &gt; 8 m s −1 ) induce mixing, distributing freshwater inputs to depths greater than 20 m. Lower wind speeds ( U ≤ 8 m s −1 ) allow freshwater lenses to remain at the surface. Results suggest that local precipitation is important in setting the freshwater seasonal cycle of the CCS and that the formation of freshwater lenses should be considered for identifying impacts of atmospheric variability on the upper ocean in the CCS on weather event time scales. Significance Statement Atmospheric rivers produce large amounts of rainfall. The purpose of this study is to understand how this rain impacts the surface ocean in the California Current System on seasonal and event time scales. Our results show that a greater precipitation over the rainy season leads to a larger decrease in salinity over time. On shorter time scales, these atmospheric river precipitation events commonly produce a surface salinity response that is detectable by ocean instruments. This salinity response depends on the amount of rainfall and the wind speed. In general, higher wind speeds will cause the freshwater input from rain to mix deeper, while lower wind speeds will have reduced mixing, allowing a layer of freshwater to persist at the surface.",Examines atmospheric river impacts on ocean salinity and stratification within the climate system.,Journal of Physical Oceanography,2022,52,8,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jpo-d-21-0272.1,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,11,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Adding predictors with geographic information and location-specific normalization of forecast information permits the use of a single ANN for the entire forecast domain and thus reduces the risk of overfitting. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed that extends the basic ANN and takes images of large-scale predictors as inputs that inform local increase or decrease of precipitation probabilities relative to climatology. Both methods are demonstrated with ECMWF ensemble reforecasts over California for lead times up to 4 weeks. They compare favorably with a state-of-the-art postprocessing technique developed for medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts, and their forecast skill relative to climatology is positive everywhere within the domain.

Well-established ETC and AR detection methods are applied to reanalysis over the North Pacific during the 1979–2009 cool seasons (November–March). Of the 3137 cyclogenesis cases detected, 35% are associated with a nearby AR at the time of initial cyclogenesis. Of all 448 cyclones that deepened explosively in the 24 h after their initiation, 60% began with a preexisting AR nearby. The roles of both dry and diabatic processes that contribute to cyclogenesis are examined, specifically, low-level baroclinicity, upper-level forcing, water vapor inflow, and latent heating. ETCs that develop associated with a preexisting AR receive nearly 80% more water vapor inflow on average, enhancing latent heating and intensifying cyclone deepening in the genesis stage. In contrast, neither low-level baroclinicity nor upper-level potential vorticity exhibit statistically significant differences between cyclogenesis events with and without an AR. Cyclogenesis events associated with an exceptionally strong AR at the ETC initial time deepen even more rapidly in the genesis stage, indicating that the intensity of an antecedent AR can modulate cyclogenesis. About half of the cyclogenesis cases off the U.S. West Coast are associated with ARs at their initial time.

Despite the storms’ contrasting characteristics, diabatic processes within the system were critical to the development of MFWs, the timing and magnitude of integrated vapor transport (IVT), and precipitation impacts over the Russian River watershed in both cases. Low-altitude circulations and lower-tropospheric moisture content in and around the MFWs are considerably reduced without latent heating, contributing to a decrease in moisture transport, moisture convergence, and IVT. Differences in IVT are not consistently dynamic (i.e., wind-driven) or thermodynamic (i.e., moisture-driven), but instead vary by case and by time throughout each event. For one event, AR conditions over the watershed persisted for 6 h less and the peak IVT occurred 6 h earlier and was reduced by ~17%; weaker orographic and dynamic precipitation forcings reduced precipitation totals by ~64%. Similarly, turning off latent heating shortened the second event by 24 h and reduced precipitation totals by ~49%; the maximum IVT over the watershed was weakened by ~42% and delayed by 18 h. Thus, sufficient representation of diabatic processes, and by inference, water vapor initial conditions, is critical for resolving MFWs, their feedbacks on AR evolution, and associated precipitation forecasts on watershed scales.","Study of atmospheric rivers, frontal waves, and precipitation dynamics using an atmospheric prediction model.",Monthly Weather Review,2021,149,8,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/mwr-d-20-0364.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,11,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The closure addresses aspects that are not commonly represented in traditional cumulus convection parameterizations, and it departs from the previous assumptions of a negligible subgrid area coverage and statistical quasi-equilibrium at steady state, the latter of which becomes invalid at higher resolution. The new parameterization introduces a prognostic evolution of the convective updraft area fraction based on a moisture budget, and, together with the buoyancy-driven updraft vertical velocity, it completes the cloud-base mass flux. In addition, the new closure addresses stochasticity and includes a representation of subgrid convective organization using cellular automata as well as scale-adaptive considerations. The new cumulus convection closure shows potential for improved Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) prediction. In our simulations we observe better propagation, amplitude, and phase of the MJO in a case study relative to the control simulation. This improvement can be partly attributed to a closer coupling between low-level moisture flux convergence and precipitation as revealed by a space–time coherence spectrum. In addition, we find that enhanced organization feedback representation and stochastic effects, represented using cellular automata, further enhance the amplitude and propagation of the MJO, and they provide realistic uncertainty estimates of convectively coupled equatorial waves at seasonal time scales. The scale-adaptive behavior of the scheme is also studied by running the global model with 25-, 13-, 9-, and 3-km grid spacing.

We examine the impacts of both AR Recon and non-AR Recon drifter observations in the U.S. Navy’s global atmospheric data assimilation (DA) and forecast system using data-denial experiments and forecast sensitivity observation impact (FSOI) analysis, which estimates the impact of each observation on the 24-h global forecast error total energy. Considering all drifters in the eastern North Pacific for the 2020 AR Recon season, FSOI indicates that most of the beneficial impacts come from observations in the lowest quartile of observed surface pressure values, particularly those taken late in the DA window. Observations in the upper quartile have near-neutral impacts on average and are slightly nonbeneficial when taken late in the DA window. This may occur because the DA configuration used here does not account for model biases, and innovation statistics show that the forecast model has a low pressure bias at high pressures. Case studies and other analyses indicate large beneficial impacts coming from observations in regions with large surface pressure gradients and integrated vapor transport, such as fronts and ARs. Data-denial experiments indicate that the assimilation of AR Recon drifter observations results in a better-constrained analysis at nearby non-AR Recon drifter locations and counteracts the NAVGEM pressure bias. Assimilating the AR Recon drifter observations improves 72- and 96-h Northern Hemisphere forecasts of winds in the lower and middle troposphere, and geopotential height in the lower, middle, and upper troposphere. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to understand how observations of atmospheric pressure at the ocean surface provided by drifting buoys impact weather forecasts. Some of these drifting buoys were deployed under a program to study atmospheric rivers (ARs) to improve forecasts of high-impact weather on the West Coast. We find that these observations are most effective at reducing forecast errors when taken in regions near fronts and cyclones. The additional drifting buoys deployed under the AR Reconnaissance project reduce forecast errors at 72 and 96 h over North America and the Northern Hemisphere. These results are important because they illustrate the potential for improving forecasts by increasing the number of drifting buoy surface pressure observations over the world oceans.","The article discusses atmospheric pressure observations from buoys to improve weather forecasting, including high-impact weather events.",Monthly Weather Review,2022,151,1,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/mwr-d-22-0124.1,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,9,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This work examines the application of a deep learning (DL) architecture, Unet, for postprocessing deterministic numerical weather predictions of precipitation to improve their skills and for deriving forecast uncertainty. Daily accumulated 0–4-day precipitation forecasts are generated from a 34-yr reforecast based on the West Weather Research and Forecasting (West-WRF) mesoscale model, developed by the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. The Unet learns the distributional parameters associated with a censored, shifted gamma distribution. In addition, the DL framework is tested against state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including an analog ensemble, nonhomogeneous regression, and mixed-type meta-Gaussian distribution. These methods are evaluated over four years of data and the western United States. The Unet outperforms the benchmark methods at all lead times as measured by continuous ranked probability and Brier skill scores. The Unet also produces a reliable estimation of forecast uncertainty, as measured by binned spread–skill relationship diagrams. Additionally, the Unet has the best performance for extreme events (i.e., the 95th and 99th percentiles of the distribution) and for these cases, its performance improves as more training data are available.

While the mechanisms that drive NCFRs are relatively well understood, their regional characteristics, specific contribution to precipitation hazards, and their predictability in the western United States have received little research attention relative to their impact. This manuscript presents observations of NCFR physical processes made during the Atmospheric River Reconnaissance field campaign on 2 February 2019 and investigates the predictability of the observed NCFR across spatiotemporal scales and forecast lead time. Dropsonde data collected along transects of an atmospheric river (AR) and its attendant cyclone during rapid cyclogenesis, and radiosonde observations during landfall 24 h later, are used to demonstrate that a configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model skillfully reproduces the physical processes responsible for the development and maintenance of the impactful NCFR. Ensemble simulations provide quantitative uncertainty information on the representation of these features in numerical weather prediction and instill confidence in the utility of WRF as a forecast guidance tool for short- to medium-range prediction of mesoscale precipitation processes in landfalling ARs. This research incorporates novel data and methodologies to improve forecast guidance for NCFRs impacting Southern California. While this study focuses on a single event, the outlined approach to observing and predicting high-impact weather across a range of spatial and temporal scales will support regional water management and hazard mitigation, in general.","Focuses on atmospheric processes, rainbands, and weather forecasting using models.",Weather and Forecasting,2020,35,5,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/waf-d-20-0012.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/wefo/35/5/wafD200012.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,20,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Landfalling ARs may produce numerous beneficial (e.g., drought amelioration and watershed recharge) and hazardous (e.g., flash flooding and heavy snow) impacts that may require the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue watches, warnings, and advisories (WWAs). Prior research on WWAs and ARs in California found that 50%–70% of days with flood-related and 60%–80% of days with winter weather–related WWAs occurred on days with landfalling ARs in California. The present study further investigates this relationship for landfalling ARs and WWAs during the cool seasons of 2006–18 across the entire western United States and considers additional dimensions of AR intensity and duration. Across the western United States, regional maxima of 70%–90% of days with WWAs issued for any hazard type were associated with landfalling ARs. In the Pacific Northwest and central regions, flood-related and wind-related WWAs were also more frequently associated with more intense and longer-duration ARs. While a large majority of days with WWAs were associated with landfalling ARs, not all landfalling ARs were necessarily associated with WWAs (i.e., not all ARs are hazardous). For example, regional maxima of only 50%–70% of AR days were associated with WWAs issued for any hazard type. However, as landfalling AR intensity and duration increased, the association with a WWA and the “hazard footprint” of WWAs increased quasi-exponentially across the western United States.","Analyzes long-term patterns and impacts of atmospheric rivers and associated weather warnings, fitting a climatological study.",Weather and Forecasting,2021,36,3,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/waf-d-20-0212.1,,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In this paper we demonstrate a methodology to combine information from multiple high-resolution hourly QPE products to evaluate QPFs from NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model in a region of Northern California. The methodology uses the quantiles of monthly QPE distributions to determine a range of hourly precipitation that correspond to “good,” “possible,” “underestimated,” or “overestimated” QPFs. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of the methodology to evaluate QPFs for seven atmospheric river events that occurred during the 2016–17 wet season in Northern California. Because the presence of frozen precipitation is often not captured by traditional QPE products, we evaluate QPFs both for all precipitation, and with likely frozen precipitation excluded.

A two-stage process is applied to seasonal predictions from two models (NCEP CFSv2 and ECMWF SEAS5) through 1) postprocessing to remove biases in the mean, variance, and ensemble spread and 2) further reducing the residual errors by linear regression using climate indices. The adjusted forecasts from the two models are combined to form a superensemble using weights based on their prior skill. The adjusted forecasts are consistently improved over raw model forecasts probabilistically for all variables and deterministically for SWE forecasts. Overall skill of the superensemble usually improves upon the skill of forecasts from individual models; however, the percentage of seasons and regions with increased skill was approximately the same as those with decreased skill relative to the top performing postprocessed individual model. Seasonal SWE has the highest prediction skill, followed by T2m, with P showing lower prediction skill. Persistence contributes strongly to the skill of SWE and moderately to the skill of T2m.

A yet unresolved issue is whether forecast skill benefits from the use of prior skill from each model in providing a weighted combination. Here we use the available seasonal ensemble forecasts of six models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) to study various aspects of prior skill-based weighting schemes and explore ways to merge multi-model forecasts. First, we post-process each NMME model through quantile mapping and a simple spread error adjustment. Then, using an equal weighted combination as the baseline forecast, we test merging the models together through skill-based weights by varying the prior skill metric and varying how the metrics are aggregated across the different subbasins and time of year. Results confirm prior work that the combined forecasts do outperform individual models. When evaluating prior skill, equal weighting generally performed as well or slightly better than all weighting schemes tried.

A stalling of the AR along the coast focused upslope moisture flux and precipitation in Central California where a debris flow on the site of the 2020 Dolan Fire on Rat Creek closed U.S. Highway 1. This study focuses on illustrating the multimodel forecast uncertainty of the landfalling AR and associated precipitation at lead times of 1–7 days and identifying the synoptic-scale processes responsible for the forecast uncertainty upstream over the North Pacific prior to landfall. The Global Forecast System (GFS) deterministic and ensemble model forecasts provided an additional ∼2–3-day lead time of the landfall of the AR as compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) deterministic and ensemble model forecasts. Once AR landfall was resolved, the ECMWF deterministic and ensemble model forecasts contained better forecasts of the stalling of the AR along the coast and its associated precipitation; both models contained dry precipitation forecast biases along the coast. Model comparisons illustrated that upstream forecast uncertainty was reduced in ECMWF forecasts initialized between 21 and 22 January 2021 and how they resolved the amplification and downstream dispersion of a Rossby wave train on 24–25 January 2021 over the western and central North Pacific. The study also motivates the importance of AR Reconnaissance activities over the North Pacific in reducing forecast uncertainty and the potential value of increasing observations of key physical processes over the western North Pacific. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sources of upstream forecast uncertainty over the North Pacific basin that influence the likelihood and characteristics of landfalling atmospheric rivers along the U.S. West Coast and their associated precipitation. The results demonstrate the importance of investigating, better observing, and improving forecasts of processes involving tropical and subtropical moisture, cyclone intensification, and jet stream variability.","The article focuses on atmospheric processes, weather patterns, and forecast uncertainty of an atmospheric river event.",Weather and Forecasting,2025,40,8,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/waf-d-24-0088.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

FIRO aims to provide increased operational flexibility to optimize competing resource objectives within a catchment area, its reservoir, and regions downstream. While there are many physical, hydrological, environmental, and engineering considerations that make FIRO potentially viable versus impractical at any given reservoir and dam, the potential success of FIRO nationwide relies fundamentally on quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) and streamflow forecast skill from numerical weather prediction and/or operational forecast guidance. This study demonstrates that western U.S. watersheds in California, Oregon, and Washington exhibit on average the highest QPF skill based on the critical success index (CSI) for extreme watershed precipitation days (quantified by mean areal precipitation values above the top 1% of wet days locally). Watersheds in New England and the mid-Atlantic exhibit similarly high QPF skill but reveal a more rapid decrease in skill as lead times increase. The national variability in QPF skill is reflected within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) portfolio of dams with highest watershed QPF skill for sites within the Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Wilmington, Charleston, Baltimore, and New England Districts, among others. The results of this study motivate further national QPF skill analyses as part of the “FIRO Phase III: National Expansion Pathfinder” effort to develop and apply a FIRO screening process nationally across the USACE portfolio of dams.

Brandenberg; Pengfei Wang,University of California Los Angeles; Old Dominion University,,engineering,civil engineering,0.95,"Sites located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region of California typically have peaty-organic soils near the ground surface, which are characteristically soft, with shear wave velocities as low as 30 m/s. These unusually soft geotechnical conditions, which are outside the range of applicability of existing ergodic site amplification models, can be anticipated to produce significant site effects during earthquake shaking. We evaluate site response for 36 seismic stations in the Delta region using non-ergodic methods with low-amplitude ground motion data. We model first-order site effects using a period-dependent relation conditioned on the 30 m time-averaged shear wave velocity ( V S30 ). Relative to extrapolations of global ergodic models, this Delta-specific model provides lower and higher levels of amplification for short and long periods, respectively. While the local model provides unbiased predictions for Delta sites as a whole, it smooths over site-specific effects such as resonant peaks. Microtremor-based horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (mHVSRs) were measured for 34 sites, from which additional site parameters such as peak frequency ( f p ), peak amplitude ( a p ), and average mHVSR amplitude over some frequency bandwidth ([Formula: see text]) are derived. Sites with prominent mHVSR peaks are found to often exhibit site resonance effects, while sites without prominent peak features generally do not. A modified Ricker wavelet pulse function conditioned on f p is used to model resonance effects, while a logistic function whose amplitude is correlated with [Formula: see text] is used to model general broadband amplification that transitions to zero at long periods. These mHVSR-informed models are implemented as additive components to the V S30 -scaling model. Relative to a global ergodic model, the V S30 -scaling model does not appreciably change the site-to-site aleatory variability ([Formula: see text]) for periods shorter than about 1.5 s but reduces [Formula: see text] by ~0.1 (natural log units) at long periods. When the mHVSR-informed model components are used, [Formula: see text] is reduced by ~0.05 to 0.1 for short-to-intermediate periods (up to ~2 s).

Baerwald; Ken M. Jeffries,University of Manitoba; California Department of Water Resources,,biological and ecological sciences,genomic DNA,0.9,"Messenger RNA sequencing is becoming more common in studies of non-model species and is most often used for gene expression-based investigations. However, the method holds potential for numerous other applications as well—including analyses of alternative splicing, population structure, and signatures of selection. To maximize the utility of mRNA data sets, distinct analyses may be combined such as by exploring dynamics between gene expression with signatures of selection in the context of population structure. Here, we compare two published data sets describing two populations of a minnow species endemic to the San Francisco Estuary (Sacramento splittail, Pogonichthys macrolepidotus ): a microsatellite data set showing population structure, and an mRNA whole transcriptome data set obtained after the two populations were exposed to a salinity challenge. We compared measures of population structure and genetic variation using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) called from mRNA from the whole transcriptome sequencing study with those patterns determined from microsatellites. For investigating plasticity and evolution, intra- and inter-population transcriptome plasticity was investigated with differential gene expression, differential exon usage, and gene expression variation. Outlier SNP analysis was also performed on the mRNA data set and signatures of selection and phenotypic plasticity were investigated on an individual-gene basis. Results We found that mRNA sequencing revealed patterns of population structure consistent with those found with microsatellites, but with lower magnitudes of genetic variation and population differentiation consistent with widespread purifying selection expected when using mRNA. In addition, within individual genes, phenotypic plasticity or signatures of selection were found in almost mutual exclusion (except heatr6 , nfu1 , slc22a6 , sya , and mmp13 ). Conclusions These results show that an mRNA sequencing data set may have multiple uses, including describing population structure and for investigating the mechanistic interplay of evolution and plasticity in adaptation. MRNA sequencing thus complements traditional sequencing methods used for population genetics, in addition to its utility for describing phenotypic plasticity.","Focuses on mRNA sequencing, gene expression, population genetics, and adaptation mechanisms in an organism.",BMC Genomics,2021,22,1,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07592-4,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12864-021-07592-4,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,15,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Melinda R.

Whitlock,University of Washington; Columbia Basin College,,biological and ecological sciences,fisheries biology,0.95,"Acoustic telemetry is a powerful tool for studying fish behavior and survival that relies on the assumption that tag detection reflects the presence of live study subjects. This assumption is violated when tag signals continue to be recorded after consumption by predators. When such tag predation is possible, it is necessary for researchers to diagnose and remove these non-representative detections. Past studies have employed a variety of data-filtering techniques to address the issue, ranging from rule-based algorithms that rely on expert judgements of behavior and movement capabilities of study subjects and their predators to automated pattern-recognition techniques using multivariate analyses. We compare four approaches for flagging suspicious tracks or detection events: two rule-based expert-opinion approaches of differing complexity and two unsupervised pattern-recognition approaches with and without data from deliberately tagged predators. We compare alternative approaches by applying these four filters to a case study of survival estimation of acoustic-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) in the San Joaquin River, California, United States. Results Filtering approaches differed in the number and composition of tags suspected of being consumed by predators; the largest differences occurred between the two broad categories, rule-based versus pattern recognition. All methods required some investigator judgement and all flagged a small subset (5%) of suspicious tags that had exceptionally long residence times and evidence of upstream transitions; 27% of tags showed evidence of predation based on at least one filter. The complex rule-based filter deemed the most tags suspicious (21%) and the simpler pattern-recognition method the fewest (10%). Reach-specific survival estimates from the four filters were mostly within 2% of the unfiltered estimates, but differences up to 11% were observed. Conclusions Sensitivity of survival results to tag predation and predator filtering depends on the study setting, spatiotemporal scale of inference, and habitat use of predators. Choice of filtering technique depends on the data available and knowledge of the study system. We recommend that survival studies include clear documentation of filtering methods and report on robustness of results to the filtering approach selected.","Studies fish survival using telemetry in river systems, relevant to fisheries management.",Animal Biotelemetry,2022,10,1,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40317-022-00283-1,https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40317-022-00283-1,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,5,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The methodology is based on the difference in the distribution of resistivity values above and below the TSZ, using the WTE measurements to optimize two components of the general workflow. From the AEM data acquired in Tulare County, in the southern portion of the Central Valley, where the WTE measurements were acquired two to four weeks before the AEM data acquisition, we have found estimates of the TSZ with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 10.6 m when compared to the WTE measurements. From the two survey areas in Butte and Glenn counties, in the northern portion of the Central Valley, where WTE measurements were available at the time of, and closer to the locations of, AEM data acquisition, we have found estimates of the TSZ with an rms error ranging from 3.8 to 5.3 m, depending on the form of inversion. The level of error found in the three survey areas is comparable to the thickness of the layers in the resistivity models at the depths of the TSZ.

Results from an AEM survey in Butte and Glenn Counties, California, USA, where 41 water wells are located within 100 m of the AEM flight lines, provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of water wells on AEM data. Based on systematic numerical analyses and examination of the field data, we find that the only noise source related to the wells that affects the AEM signals in our study area is the power lines; the effect of the steel casings in the study area is negligible. Our numerical simulations yield two important findings: (1) the effect of the power line is mainly dependent upon the resistivity of the ground pathway between the base of the power-line poles, and (2) for the resistivity structure in the study area, when the ground contact resistance is sufficiently low, the effect of the power line will be observed in the AEM data until there is a separation distance of 174 m from the power line; the total power-line percentage effect less than 3% has been considered to be negligible. However, we find that, in the field data, an average separation distance between the power line and high-quality AEM data (i.e., no impact from the power lines) is only 60% of this predicted distance. We attribute this to the high ground contact resistance caused by degradation of the grounded electrodes located at the bottom of the power-line poles. For our 41 wells, after removing any soundings contaminated by power-line noise, we are left with high-quality soundings located 0–160 m from the water wells, with an average distance of 77 m.",Analysis of airborne electromagnetic data and noise sources affecting subsurface resistivity measurements.,Geophysics,2020,86,2,Society of Exploration Geophysicists,https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2020-0089.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This methodology was developed and tested using AEM data and well sediment type and resistivity logs from Butte and Glenn Counties in the California Central Valley. Our methodology accounts for the spatially varying sensitivity of the AEM method by constructing different transforms separated based on the sensitivity of the AEM method. The large spatial separation that typically exists between the AEM data and the wells with sediment type logs was avoided by planning the acquisition of AEM data so as to fly as close as possible to the well locations. We had 55 locations with sediment type logs and AEM data separated by 100 m, determined to be the maximum acceptable separation distance. Differences in vertical resolution between the AEM method and the sediment type logs were addressed by modeling the physics of the AEM measurement, allowing for a comparison of field and AEM data generated during the MCMC process. The influence of saturation state was captured by creating one set of transforms for the region above the top of the saturated zone and another for below. Using the set of transforms developed at the 55 locations, an inverse distance weighting scheme that included a well quality ranking was used to construct a set of 12 (six sensitivity bins, and two saturation states) resistivity-to-sediment-type transforms at every AEM data location. These represent a set of transforms that accommodate the variation in AEM sensitivity and are independent of the inversion used to retrieve the resistivity model.

Today, the former floodplain is extensively managed for agriculture. Lack of access to inundated floodplains is recognized as a significant contributing factor in the decline of native Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We observed differences in salmon growth rate, invertebrate density, and carbon source in food webs from three aquatic habitat types—leveed river channels, perennial drainage canals in the floodplain, and agricultural floodplain wetlands. Over 23 days (17 February to 11 March, 2016) food web structure and juvenile Chinook Salmon growth rates were studied within the three aquatic habitat types. Zooplankton densities on the floodplain wetland were 53x more abundant, on average, than in the river. Juvenile Chinook Salmon raised on the floodplain wetland grew at 0.92 mm/day, 5x faster than fish raised in the adjacent river habitat (0.18 mm/day). Two aquatic-ecosystem modeling methods were used to partition the sources of carbon (detrital or photosynthetic) within the different habitats. Both modeling approaches found that carbon in the floodplain wetland food web was sourced primarily from detrital sources through heterotrophic pathways, while carbon in the river was primarily photosynthetic and sourced from in situ autotrophic production. Hydrologic conditions typifying the ephemerally inundated floodplain—shallower depths, warmer water, longer water residence times and predominantly detrital carbon sources compared to deeper, colder, swifter water and a predominantly algal-based carbon source in the adjacent river channel—appear to facilitate the dramatically higher rates of food web production observed in the floodplain.

In summer 2018 we used a unique water control structure in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) to direct a managed flow pulse into Suisun Marsh, one of the largest contiguous tidal marshes on the west coast of the United States. The action was designed to increase habitat suitability for the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small osmerid fish endemic to the upper SFE. The approach was to operate the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates (SMSCG) in conjunction with increased Sacramento River tributary inflow to direct an estimated 160 x 106 m3 pulse of low salinity water into Suisun Marsh during August, a critical time period for juvenile Delta Smelt rearing. Three-dimensional modeling showed that directing additional low salinity water into Suisun Marsh (""Flow Action"") substantially increased the area of low salinity habitat for Delta Smelt that persisted beyond the period of SMSCG operations. Field monitoring showed that turbidity and chlorophyll were at higher levels in Suisun Marsh, representing better habitat conditions, than the upstream Sacramento River region throughout the study period. The Flow Action had no substantial effects on zooplankton abundance, nor did Suisun Marsh show enhanced levels of these prey species in comparison to the Sacramento River. Fish monitoring data suggested that small numbers of Delta Smelt colonized Suisun Marsh from the Sacramento River during the 2018 Flow Action. Comparison of the salinity effects of the Flow Action to historical catch data for Suisun Marsh further supported our hypothesis that the Flow Action would have some benefit for this rare species. Our study provides insight into both the potential use of targeted flow manipulations to support endangered fishes such as Delta Smelt, and into the general response of estuarine habitat to flow management.",Evaluates flow manipulation to enhance habitat for an endangered fish species.,PLoS ONE,2020,15,10,Public Library of Science (PLoS),https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234673,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234673&type=printable,TRUE,TRUE,gold,public-domain,19,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,Ted Sommer,1,DISE

Recently, through cooperative agreements with diverse stakeholders, winter-flooded agricultural rice fields in California's Central Valley have emerged as ecologically functioning floodplain rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon. From 2013 to 2016, we conducted a series of experiments examining methods to enhance habitat benefits for fall-run Chinook Salmon reared on winter-flooded rice fields in the Yolo Bypass, a modified floodplain managed for flood control, agriculture, and wildlife habitat in the Sacramento River Valley of California. Investigations included studying the effect of 1) post-harvest field substrate; 2) depth refugia; 3) duration of field drainage; and 4) duration of rearing occupancy on in-situ diet, growth and survival of juvenile salmon. Post-harvest substrate treatment had only a small effect on the lower trophic food web and an insignificant effect on growth rates or survival of rearing hatchery-origin, fall-run Chinook Salmon. Similarly, depth refugia, created by trenches dug to various depths, also had an insignificant effect on survival. Rapid field drainage yielded significantly higher survival compared to drainage methods drawn out over longer periods. A mortality of approximately one third was observed in the first week after fish were released in the floodplain. This initial mortality event was followed by high, stable survival rates for the remainder of the 6-week duration of floodplain rearing study. Across years, in-field survival ranged 7.4-61.6% and increased over the course of the experiments. Despite coinciding with the most extreme drought in California's recorded history, which elevated water temperatures and reduced the regional extent of adjacent flooded habitats which concentrated avian predators, the adaptive research framework enabled incremental improvements in design to increase survival. Zooplankton (fish food) in the winter-flooded rice fields were 53-150x more abundant than those sampled concurrently in the adjacent Sacramento River channel. Correspondingly, observed somatic growth rates of juvenile hatchery-sourced fall-run Chinook Salmon stocked in rice fields were two to five times greater than concurrently and previously observed growth rates in the adjacent Sacramento River. The abundance of food resources and exceptionally high growth rates observed during these experiments illustrate the potential benefits of using existing agricultural infrastructure to approximate the floodplain wetland physical conditions and hydrologic patterns (shallow, long-duration inundation of cool floodplain habitats in mid-winter) under which Chinook Salmon evolved and to which they are adapted.",Study of salmon population dynamics and habitat management in agricultural floodplains.,PLoS ONE,2021,16,2,Public Library of Science (PLoS),https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237686,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237686&type=printable,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Restoring such wetlands may provide one of several effective negative emission technologies to remove atmospheric CO2 and mitigate climate change. However, there remains considerable uncertainty whether these heterogeneous ecotones are consistent net C sinks and to what degree restoration and management methods affect C sequestration. Since wetland C dynamics are largely driven by climate, it is difficult to draw comparisons across regions. With many restored wetlands having different functional outcomes, we need to better understand the importance of site-specific conditions and how they change over time. We report on 21 site-years of C fluxes using eddy covariance measurements from five restored fresh to brackish wetlands in a Mediterranean climate. The wetlands ranged from 3 to 23 years after restoration and showed that several factors related to restoration methods and site conditions altered the magnitude of C sequestration by affecting vegetation cover and structure. Vegetation established within two years of re-flooding but followed different trajectories depending on design aspects, such as bathymetry-determined water levels, planting methods, and soil nutrients. A minimum of 55% vegetation cover was needed to become a net C sink, which most wetlands achieved once vegetation was established. Established wetlands had a high C sequestration efficiency (i.e. the ratio of net to gross ecosystem productivity) comparable to upland ecosystems but varied between years undergoing boom-bust growth cycles and C uptake strength was susceptible to disturbance events. We highlight the large C sequestration potential of productive inundated marshes, aided by restoration design and management targeted to maximise vegetation extent and minimise disturbance. These findings have important implications for wetland restoration, policy, and management practitioners.",Study of restored wetlands as CO2 sinks for atmospheric carbon reduction and climate change mitigation.,PLoS ONE,2021,16,3,Public Library of Science (PLoS),https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248398,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248398&type=printable,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,70,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Since 1996, a captive breeding program has existed for the federally threatened and California endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus , an osmerid fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary. Although this program serves as a captive refuge population, with experimental releases being initiated to supplement the wild population, it was uncertain how individuals would survive, feed, and maintain condition outside hatchery conditions. We evaluated this and the effects of three enclosure designs (41% open, 63% open, and 63% open with partial outer mesh wrap) on growth, survival, and feeding efficacy of cultured Delta Smelt at two locations (Sacramento River near Rio Vista, CA and in Sacramento River Deepwater Ship Channel) in the wild. Enclosures exposed fish to semi-natural conditions (ambient environmental fluctuations and wild food resources) but prevented escape and predation. After four weeks, survival was high for all enclosure types (94–100%) at both locations. The change in condition and weight was variable between sites, increasing at the first location but decreasing at the second location. Gut content analysis showed that fish consumed wild zooplankton that came into the enclosures. Cumulatively, results show that captive-reared Delta Smelt can survive and forage successfully when housed in enclosures under semi-natural conditions in the wild. When comparing enclosure types, we observed no significant difference in fish weight changes ( p = 0.58–0.81 across sites). The success of housing captive-reared Delta Smelt in enclosures in the wild provides preliminary evidence that these fish may be suitable to supplement the wild population in the San Francisco Estuary. Furthermore, these enclosures are a new tool to test the efficacy of habitat management actions or to acclimate fish to wild conditions as a soft release strategy for recently initiated supplementation efforts.",Evaluates survival and feeding of captive-bred Delta Smelt for population supplementation.,PLoS ONE,2023,18,5,Public Library of Science (PLoS),https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286027,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286027&type=printable,TRUE,TRUE,gold,public-domain,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,Melinda R.

This study explored differential responses to infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza in Snow Geese ( Anser caerulescens ) located in the California Central Valley. Though H5 antibody prevalence was high across years among birds sampled in the winter (75% in both years via hemagglutination inhibition), these values were even higher among birds sampled in summer that failed to migrate (i.e., August 2023 = 100% and August 2024 = 93% via hemagglutination inhibition). Birds that failed to migrate were also generally lighter than birds sampled in the winter and presented notable damage to cerebrum and cerebellum. In December 2022, a single individual positive for infection with H5N1 at the time of sampling indicated reduced movement during the 14 days following sampling but completed spring migration comparably with uninfected conspecifics. However, while no birds were actively infected during sampling and marking in 2023, two marked geese departed for migration late and one did not migrate at all. Additional banded birds marked in August have been reencountered in scenarios ranging from hunter harvest at a different site over a year later to found dead shortly after banding. Our data indicate that Snow Geese infected with HPAI have the potential to express variable outcomes following infection with highly pathogenic H5N1, ranging from rapid recovery within a migratory season to death.

Here, we implement a previously proposed process-based conceptual model to study entrainment rates based on three linked elements: the entrainment zone, critical streakline, and cross-sectional distribution of fish. The critical streakline is the location along a channel cross-section immediately upstream of a junction that forms the spatial divide between parcels of water that enter a side channel or remain in the main channel. The critical streakline therefore divides the main channel into entrainment zones within which fish would likely enter each channel. Combined with information about the cross-sectional distribution of fish upstream of a junction, this conceptual model provides a means to predict fish entrainment into each channel. To apply this conceptual model, we combined statistical models of the critical streakline, the cross-sectional distribution of acoustic tagged juvenile Chinook salmon, and their probability of entrainment into Georgiana Slough. We fit joint beta regression and logistic regression models to acoustic telemetry data gathered in 2011 and 2012 to estimate the cross-sectional distribution of fish upstream of the junction, and to estimate the probability of entrainment for fish on either side of the critical streakline. We show that entrainment rates can be predicted by understanding how the combination of critical streakline position and cross-sectional distribution of fish co-vary as a function of environmental covariates. By integrating over individual positions and entrainment fates to arrive at population-level entrain probability in relation to environmental covariates, our model offers managers a simple but powerful tool to evaluate how alternative actions affect migrating fish.",Predicting fish movement and entrainment for salmon management.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2020,18,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2020v18iss1art3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1wr2f87f/qt1wr2f87f.pdf?t=q74cip,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Xiaochung Wang,6,BDO

A long-term monitoring program, such as the Interagency Ecological Program, comprises a suite of surveys, each conducted by a state or federal agency or academic institution. These types of programs have produced rich data sets that are useful for tracking species trends over time. Problems arise from drawing conclusions based on one or few surveys because each survey samples a different subset of species or reflects different spatial or temporal trends in abundance. The challenges in using data sets from these surveys for comparative purposes stem from methodological differences, magnitude of data, incompatible data formats, and end-user preference for familiar surveys. To improve the utility of these data sets and encourage multi-survey analyses, we quantitatively rate these surveys based on their ability to represent species trends, present a methodology for integrating long-term data sets, and provide examples that highlight the importance of expanded analyses. We identify areas and species that are under-sampled, and compare fish salvage data from large water export facilities with survey data. Our analysis indicates that while surveys are redundant for some species, no two surveys are completely duplicative.

Based on successful partnerships between agriculture and conservation groups to support migrating waterfowl, we examined whether seasonally flooded rice fields could be modified to provide off-channel rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. During winter and spring of 2012-2017, we conducted a series of experiments in Yolo Bypass and other regions of California’s Central Valley using hatchery Chinook Salmon as a surrogate for wild Chinook Salmon, the management target for our project. Overall, we found that seasonally flooded fields are highly productive, resulting in significantly higher levels of zooplankton and high Chinook Salmon growth rates as compared to the adjacent Sacramento River. We found similar results for multiple geographical areas in the Central Valley, and in different cover types, such as non-rice crops and fallow areas. Although field substrate type did not detectably affect fish growth and survival, connectivity with upstream and downstream areas appeared to drive fish occupancy, because rearing young salmon were generally attracted to inflow in the fields, and not all of the fish successfully emigrated off the fields without efficient drainage. In general, we faced numerous logistic and environmental challenges to complete our research. For example, periodic unmanaged floods in the Yolo Bypass made it difficult to schedule and complete experiments. During severe drought conditions, we found that managed agricultural habitats produced low and variable salmon survival results, likely because of periodically high temperatures and concentrated avian predation. In addition, our project required substantial landowner time and effort to install and maintain experimental fields. Recent and future infrastructure improvements in Yolo Bypass could substantially improve options for experimental work and broaden efforts to enhance salmon habitat.","Study on using agricultural floodplain habitat for Chinook Salmon rearing, growth, and survival.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2020,18,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2020v18iss3art4,https://escholarship.org/content/qt89m8c4zq/qt89m8c4zq.pdf?t=qhi1zo,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,17,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Ted Sommer,1,DISE

To be effective, conditions in fishways need to meet the specific hydraulic requirements, as well as abilities, behavior, and size consideration for all fish species being considered. Turbulence, water depth, velocity, passage location, and design of a passage facility are essential elements to successful fish passage.

Parameters of the population model are estimated by maximum likelihood by comparing predictions to data from Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) and Spring Kodiak Trawl (SKT) surveys, as well as to daily salvage estimates. Our objectives are to evaluate different movement behavior hypotheses, to rank estimates of PEL based on how well predictions fit the data, and to sharpen our understanding of the data to inform future research and monitoring decisions. We applied the modeling framework to data from water year 2002—a year when salvage was high—and tested 30 combinations of six behavior and five population dynamics models. More complex process and observation assumptions in the population model led to much improved fits in most cases, but did not appreciably influence PEL predictions, which were largely determined by movement predictions from the BMMs. Estimates of PEL varied considerably among behaviors (2% to 40%). The model with the highest predictive capability explained 98% of the variation in FMWT data across regions, 70% of the variation in SKT data across regions and surveys, and 28% and 43% of the daily variation in salvage at federal and state fish screening facilities, respectively. The PEL estimate from this model was 35%, more than double the original estimate from Kimmerer (2008) of 15%. While PEL estimates provided in this study should be considered preliminary, our framework for testing combined behavior-driven movement models and population dynamics models is an improvement compared to earlier efforts.",Modeling fish population dynamics and entrainment loss of endangered Delta Smelt for conservation.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss1art1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt8p60c0cs/qt8p60c0cs.pdf?t=qq5078,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,12,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Here, we analyzed juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) bycatch data that has been collected by the recently established Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program (EDSM), a survey designed to estimate the abundance and distribution of the San Francisco Estuary’s (estuary) endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Two key aspects of the EDSM program distinguish it from other fish surveys in the estuary: a stratified random sampling design and the spatial scale of its sampling effort. We integrated the EDSM data set with other existing surveys in the estuary, and used an occupancy model to assess differences in the probability of detecting Delta Smelt across gear types. We saw no large-scale differences in size selectivity, and while detection probability varied among gear types, cumulative detection probability for EDSM was comparable to other surveys because of the program’s use of replicate tows. Based on our occupancy model and sampling effort in the estuary during spring of 2017 and 2018, we highlighted under-sampled regions that saw improvements in monitoring coverage from EDSM. Our analysis also revealed that each sampling method has its own benefits and constraints. Although the use of random sites with replicates, as conducted by EDSM, can provide more statistically robust abundance estimates relative to traditional methods, the use of fixed stations and simple methods such as beach seining may provide a more cost-effective way to monitor salmon occurrence in certain regions of the estuary. Leveraging the strengths of each survey’s method can enable stronger inferences on salmon abundance and distribution.

The distribution of Delta Smelt in the estuary shifts landward from low-salinity habitat to freshwater habitat before spawning. This spawning migration often coincides with the first substantial freshwater inflow to the estuary during winter. To accomplish this landward shift in distribution, Delta Smelt are believed to use the tides by swimming to faster-moving currents during flood tides and then repositioning themselves to slower-moving currents to reduce seaward movement on ebb tides. Studies have hypothesized that the swimming behavior of Delta Smelt during this period is influenced by environmental conditions such as salinity and turbidity. The details of these swimming behaviors—including the extent to which flows, salinity, and turbidity affect behaviors and distributions—are uncertain. The spawning migration is of management interest because an increase in observed counts of Delta Smelt at the South Delta water-export facilities has coincided roughly with the spawning migration in many years. In this study, we investigated a range of hypothesized swimming behaviors using a three-dimensional particle-tracking model for water year 2002 during the spawning migration, and compared the predicted distributions of Delta Smelt to distributions inferred from catch data. Our goal was to improve understanding of the influence of Delta Smelt swimming on distribution, and, ultimately, to develop a modeling tool to help management agencies identify conditions associated with entrainment losses. Predictions of Delta Smelt distributions and entrainment varied greatly among behaviors. Without swimming, Delta Smelt would be rapidly transported seaward of Suisun Bay, while continuous tidal migration would move them deep into the interior Delta. These behaviors and a simple turbidity-driven behavior model predicted distributions inconsistent with observations, while more complex behavior rules allowed improved predictions.",Modeling endangered fish behavior for management and conservation.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss1art3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0dh783r5/qt0dh783r5.pdf?t=qq507a,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,9,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,3,EXEC

In the San Francisco Estuary, the state and federally listed Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) has declined to record low numbers, elevating concern over entrainment at the State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) water export facilities. The objective of this study was to: (1) revisit previous work on factors that affect adult Delta Smelt collected at the SWP and CVP fish collection facilities using updated conceptual models and a new statistical approach; and (2) to determine factors that affect salvage at time-scales of interest to management. Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models were applied to salvage data at the SWP and CVP, aggregated into two response categories: a “first flush” response that represented daily salvage from the start of the entrainment window to the 50% midpoint of observed salvage, and a “seasonal” response that included daily salvage from the entire entrainment window. Precipitation, sub-adult abundance, Yolo Bypass flow, and exports best explained first flush salvage at both the SWP and CVP. The seasonal models included a similar set of influential variables, but the relative influence of precipitation was lower compared to the first flush models., Yolo Bypass flow was more influential for seasonal salvage at the SWP, compared to the CVP; Old and Middle River flow was more influential for seasonal salvage at the CVP. Although the rank of variable importance that explains salvage differed slightly between first flush and seasonal time-scales, this study suggests that salvage is most influenced by hydrodynamics, water quality, and population abundance. The application of BRT models to predict salvage is limited, because salvage has been low since federal protections were implemented in 2008.

A central question is: Can we use existing knowledge and future projections to predict and manage the anticipated ecological impacts? This was the subject of a 2018 symposium entitled “Ecological and Physiological Impacts of Salinization of Aquatic Systems from Human Activities.” The symposium brought together an inter-disciplinary group of scientists and researchers, resource managers, and policy-makers. Here, we summarize and review the presentations and discussions that arose during the symposium. From a historical perspective, salt intrusion has changed substantially over the past 10,000 years as a result of changing climate patterns, with additional shifts from recent anthropogenic effects. Current salinity patterns in the San Francisco Estuary are driven by a suite of hydrodynamic processes within the given contexts of water management and geography. Based on climate projections for the coming century, significant changes are expected in the processes that determine the spatial and temporal patterns of salinity. Given that native species—including fishes such as the Delta Smelt and Sacramento Splittail—track favorable habitats, exhibit physiological acclimation, and can adaptively evolve, we present a framework for assessing their vulnerability to altered salinity in the San Francisco Estuary. We then present a range of regulatory and structural management tools that are available to control patterns of salinity within the San Francisco Estuary. Finally, we identify major research priorities that can help fill critical gaps in our knowledge about future salinity patterns and the consequences of climate change and sea level rise.

Understanding factors that drive routing at channel junctions along the Sacramento River is therefore critical to devising management strategies that maximize survival. Here, we examine entrainment of acoustically tagged juvenile Chinook Salmon into Sutter and Steamboat sloughs from the Sacramento River. Because these sloughs divert fish away from the downstream entrances of the Delta Cross Channel and Georgiana Slough (where fish access the low-survival region of the interior Delta), management actions to increase fish entrainment into Sutter and Steamboat sloughs are being investigated to increase through-Delta survival. Previous studies suggest that fish generally “go with the flow”—as net flow into a divergence increases, the proportion of fish that enter that divergence correspondingly increases. However, complex tidal hydrodynamics at sub-daily time-scales may be decoupled from net flow. Therefore, we modeled routing of acoustic tagged juvenile salmon as a function of tidally varying hydrodynamic data, which was collected using temporary gaging stations deployed between March and May of 2014. Our results indicate that discharge, the proportion of flow that entered the slough, and the rate of change of flow were good predictors of an individual’s probability of being entrained. In addition, interactions between discharge and the proportion of flow revealed a non-linear relationship between flow and entrainment probability. We found that the highest proportions of fish are likely to be entrained into Steamboat Slough and Sutter Slough on the ascending and descending limbs of the tidal cycle, when flow changes from positive to negative. Our findings characterize how patterns of entrainment vary with tidal flow fluctuations, providing information critical for understanding the potential effect of management actions (e.g., fish guidance structures) to modify routing probabilities at this location.",Examines tidal flow's effect on juvenile salmon routing for fisheries management.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2020,19,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss2art4,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2pz5f5gg/qt2pz5f5gg.pdf?t=que1by,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,8,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In 2014–2015, a study was conducted to investigate and quantify the efficiency of this trawl for catching the endangered fish species Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). In an analysis based on that study, we calculated retention probability—the probability that a Delta Smelt is retained in the cod end of the trawl—as a function of fish length and fit a selectivity curve reflecting the relationship between size and retention. Here we return to the same gear efficiency study and further utilize the data set by (1) fitting selectivity curves for three additional pelagic fish species: Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), and Mississippi Silverside (Menidia beryllina), (2) refitting the selectivity curve for Delta Smelt to incorporate between-haul variability, and (3) calculating the lengths of 50% and 95% retention in order to characterize and compare the resulting selectivity curves. We also present retention data on age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis), all of which were retained in the cod end. We found that Threadfin Shad, American Shad, and Delta Smelt are 95% retained at 45, 49, and 61 mm fork length, respectively. Because data were limited for Mississippi Silverside, American Shad, and age-0 Striped Bass, we used body shape, in conjunction with retention data, to develop hypotheses about selectivity based on whether each species’ body shape resembles that of Threadfin Shad, which are more deep-bodied and laterally compressed, or Delta Smelt, which are more fusiform. We also found that retention-at-length was more variable for Delta Smelt than for Threadfin Shad, potentially because length is a good predictor of retention in deep-bodied, laterally compressed fish whereas maximum girth is a better predictor of retention in fusiform fish.","Examines trawl efficiency for pelagic fish species, crucial for fisheries management.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2020,19,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss2art5,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7qp278wm/qt7qp278wm.pdf?t=que1bz,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The SmeltCam is an imaging apparatus developed as a potential sampling alternative to long-term trawling gear surveys within the San Francisco Estuary, California, to reduce handling stress on sensitive species like the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Although believed to be a reliable alternative to closed cod-end trawling surveys, no formal test of sampling efficiency has been implemented using the SmeltCam. We used a paired deployment of the SmeltCam and a conventional closed cod-end trawl within the Napa River and San Pablo Bay, a Bayesian binomial N-mixture model, and data simulations to determine the sampling efficiency of both deployed gear types to capture a Delta Smelt surrogate (Northern Anchovy, Engraulis mordax) and to test potential bias in our modeling framework. We found that retention efficiency—a component of detection efficiency that estimates the probability a fish is retained by the gear, conditional on gear contact—was slightly higher using the SmeltCam (mean = 0.58) than the conventional trawl (mean = 0.47, Probability SmeltCam retention efficiency &gt; trawl retention efficiency = 94%). We also found turbidity did not affect the SmeltCam’s retention efficiency, although total fish density during an individual tow improved the trawl’s retention efficiency. Simulations also showed the binomial model was accurate when model assumptions were met.

Fin tissues were collected from approximately 7,500 juvenile Chinook Salmon captured in trawl samples between 2007 and 2011. Tissues were analyzed using 21 microsatellites to determine genetic run assignments for individuals, which we compared with LDC run assignments. Across years, there was extensive overlap among the distributions of run-specific fork lengths of genetically identified juveniles, indicating that run compositions based on LDC assignments would tend to underestimate fall-run and especially late-fall-run compositions at both trawl locations, and greatly overestimate spring-run compositions (both locations) and winter-run compositions (Chipps Island).

As a test of this concept, in summer 2016, we used a managed flow pulse to target an ecologically important region: a freshwater tidal slough complex (Cache Slough Complex–CSC). Our goal was to improve estuarine habitat by increasing net flows through CSC to enhance downstream transport of lower trophic-level resources, an important driver for fishes such as the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus. We used regional water infrastructure to direct 18.5 million m³ of Sacramento River flow into its adjacent Yolo Bypass floodplain, where the pulse continued through CSC. Simulations using a 3-D hydrodynamic model (UnTRIM) indicated that the managed flow pulse had a large effect on the net flow of water through Yolo Bypass, and between CSC and further downstream. Multiple water quality constituents (specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients [NO₃ + NO₂, NH₄, PO₄]) varied across the study region, and showed a strong response to the flow pulse. In addition, the lower Sacramento River had increased phytoplankton biomass and improved food quality indices (estimated from long-chain essential fatty acids) after the flow pulse. The managed flow pulse resulted in increased densities of zooplankton (copepods, cladocerans) demonstrating potential advection from upper floodplain channels into the target CSC and Sacramento River regions.

The water use and supply include surface water and groundwater, although groundwater reporting has been incomplete. These data are used to support the Water Plan released every 3 to 5 years and are the most comprehensive and finest spatial- and temporal-scale data set for California water resources. First, using the Bay–Delta watershed as a case example, we show that recent fluctuations in water use are highly correlated with variations in precipitation. Developed water supplies and use show these fluctuations, but they are modified by reservoir inflows and releases, groundwater supplies, and Delta outflows. Second, although the annually precipitated water supply in the Bay–Delta varies by about 30%, the developed water supply damps this considerably. The water management system maintained nearly constant agricultural water use even in periods of intense drought, with year-to-year variation of about 7%. Variability in urban water use is higher (∼20%), largely from conservation during periods of drought. Finally, this information can help improve water resource management because it connects regional-scale data to meaningful policy decision-making at county and sub-county levels. At a time when water policy and management are being re-evaluated across the American West in the light of changing climate, decision-making informed by science and data is urgently needed. The statewide water balance data provide the means to establish a consistent, quantitative framework for water resource analysis throughout the state.","Analyzes human water use patterns, supply management, and policy implications within water systems.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,4,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss4art2,https://escholarship.org/content/qt16x9z5n1/qt16x9z5n1.pdf?t=r44bj0,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,28,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

For regulatory purposes, freshwater flow to the estuary is not directly measured; rather, it is estimated from a daily balance of upstream Delta inflows, exports, and in-Delta water use termed the net Delta outflow index (NDOI). Field research in the 1960s indicated that NDOI estimates are biased low in summer–fall and biased high in winter–spring as a result of conflating Delta island evapotranspiration estimates with the sum of ungauged hydrologic interactions between channels and islands referred to as net channel depletions. In this work, we employed a 50-year observed salinity record along with gauged tidal flows and an ensemble of five empirical flow-salinity (X2) models to test whether a seasonal bias in Delta outflow estimates could be inferred. We accomplished this objective by conducting statistical analyses and evaluating whether model skill could be improved through seasonal NDOI flow adjustments. Assuming that model residuals are associated with channel depletion uncertainty, our findings corroborate the 1960s research and suggest that channel depletions are biased low in winter months (i.e., NDOI is biased high) and biased high in late summer and early fall months (i.e., NDOI is biased low). The magnitude of seasonal bias, which can reach 1,000 cfs, is a small percentage of typical winter outflow but represents a significant percentage of typical summer outflow. Our findings were derived from five independently developed models, and are consistent with the physical understanding of water exchanges on the islands. This work provides motivation for improved characterization of these exchanges to improve Delta outflow estimates, particularly during drought periods when water supplies are scarce and must be carefully managed.",Study analyzes freshwater flow estimates and seasonal biases in an estuary using salinity records and flow-salinity models.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,4,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2021v19iss4art4,https://escholarship.org/content/qt5bf4q1pt/qt5bf4q1pt.pdf?t=r44bj1,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Eli Ateljevich,3,BDO

Although disease is not an overt cause of population decline, comprehensive pathogen presence and prevalence data are lacking. Here, we performed a pilot study that applied molecular assays originally developed in salmonids to assess the presence of a wide variety of pathogens in the gill tissue of cultured and wild Delta Smelt—as well as cultured fish—deployed in enclosures in the estuary. We found the assays to be highly sensitive, and observed positive detections of a single pathogen, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, in 13% of cultured Delta Smelt. We also detected ten other pathogens at very low levels in cultured, enclosure-deployed, and wild Delta Smelt that likely represent the ambient pathogen composition in the estuary (as opposed to actual infection). Our results corroborate previous work that cultured Delta Smelt do not appear to present a high risk for pathogen transmission during population supplementation or reintroduction.

In recognition of this critical information gap, we initiated an effort to develop a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring run, defined here as an annual forecast of the number of juvenile Central Valley spring-run Chinook Salmon that enter the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (“Delta”) from the Sacramento Valley. This metric would allow for a more robust scientific assessment of the population, which is needed to effectively manage water to reduce effects on spring run, a key condition of state permit requirements. To help guide this effort, we organized a workshop for stake-holders, managers, and scientists to review some of the key aspects of spring-run biology, examine the management and conservation importance of a JPE, identify knowledge gaps, introduce new tools, and discuss alternative approaches to forecasting the number of spring run emigrating from the Sacramento River drainage and into the Delta.

While island drains are a ubiquitous feature of the Delta, limited data exist to evaluate island drainage mass fluxes in this system. To better constrain inputs from island drains, we measured monthly discharge along with nutrient and trace element concentrations in island drainage on three Delta islands and surrounding rivers from June 2017 to September 2018. These data were used to calculate island-level fluxes and then upscaled to estimate Delta-wide contributions from island drains. Based on these results, we present (1) new estimates of gross and net nutrient and trace element fluxes from Delta island drains, and (2) concomitant N stable isotope data to improve our understanding of island N cycling. Over 60% of nearly all island drainage gross nutrient and trace element loads occurred in winter and spring. Upscaled island drainage net annual total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and NH4+ loads comprised an estimated 9%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, of annual inputs to this system in 2018, before the SRWTP upgrade. Under a post-upgrade scenario, we estimated net annual island drainage TDN contributions to increase to 11% and NH4+ contributions to 45% of total Delta inputs as the SRWTP NH4+ load diminished to near zero. Our results suggest that island drainage is a measurable N source that has likely become increasingly important now that the SRWTP upgrade is complete. With over 200 potential active outfalls, these inputs may affect aquatic biogeochemical cycling in many regions of the Delta, especially in areas with long residence times.",Quantifying nutrient and trace element contributions from island drainage to assess impacts on Delta water quality.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2022,20,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2022v20iss2art5,https://escholarship.org/content/qt8bk6n2wq/qt8bk6n2wq.pdf?t=re8lpu,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

To characterize the benefits of restoration sites, it is critical to quantify the abundance and composition of fish food resources in and near the wetlands. Characterization of zooplankton communities is considered particularly important, but accurate analysis of zooplankton samples is time-consuming and expensive. The recently established Fish Restoration Program (FRP) Monitoring Team assessed whether data from existing long-term monitoring surveys could be used to characterize shallow-water zooplankton communities before restoration. During the springs of 2017 to 2019, the FRP collected zooplankton samples near the mouth of tidal wetland sites, or immediately outside future restoration sites, and compared them to concurrent samples collected in deep water by existing long-term monitoring surveys. We found very few differences in community composition between shallow and deep samples, though a few taxa were more abundant in shallow water. Seasonal and interannual differences in composition and abundance showed that restoration sites provide varying food resources over time. There was significantly higher total abundance of zooplankton in deep versus shallow water, which may be a result of differences in zooplankton production, migration, or fish predation. Inconsistencies in towing speed and gear type may also be driving this result, rather than true habitat differences. This study indicates that monitoring of wetland restoration sites must rely on multiple years of data collected on the site—rather than relying on adjacent open-water sampling—and should include monitoring of epiphytic and epibenthic invertebrates as well as zooplankton.",Assessing zooplankton communities to inform wetland restoration monitoring for fish food availability.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2022,20,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2022v20iss3art1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7t79h22f/qt7t79h22f.pdf?t=rk01xk,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

This has inspired research within the estuary at the southern edge of their distribution. However, populations also exist in other estuaries along the coast, which are far less described despite their potential importance in a meta-population. We surveyed Longfin Smelt populations along the northern California coast for larval recruitment. We conducted surveys in 2019 and 2020 to (1) identify estuaries north of the SFE where spawning occurs, and (2) evaluate how habitat features (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity) influenced Longfin Smelt larvae abundance. We detected larvae in four of 16 estuaries we surveyed, and all were large estuaries north of Cape Mendocino. No larvae were detected in eight coastal estuaries in closer proximity to the SFE. Larvae catch probability increased with turbidity and decreased with salinity with no significant influence of temperature and dissolved oxygen. In the wet winter of 2019, we observed lower densities of larvae in Humboldt Bay and the Eel River, and detected no Longfin Smelt in the Klamath and Mad Rivers; in the dry winter of 2020, we detected larvae in two additional estuaries. Possibly elevated freshwater outflow in 2019 increased transport rates to the sea, resulting in the observed low larval recruitment. Our results suggest that, while populations of Longfin Smelt exist in large estuaries north of Cape Mendocino, coastal estuaries in proximity to the SFE were either under-sampled or are not permanently inhabited by Longfin Smelt. This suggests that the threatened estuary Longfin Smelt population may lack the resiliency afforded by meta-populations and advocates for increased monitoring over a range of hydrologic conditions and improving detection probabilities for future assessments of gene flow between populations.","Study of a threatened fish population, its estuarine recruitment, and habitat factors relevant to conservation.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2022,20,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2022v20iss3art3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1z55s2xh/qt1z55s2xh.pdf?t=rk01xo,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,5,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,7,EXEC

In nearly all these interconnected changes and across scales, primary producers play a major role, with diverse effects that mitigate or exacerbate rapid change induced by climate or other human-driven perturbations. Through this anthropocentric lens, primary producers can be viewed as performing numerous ecosystem services—which ultimately benefit humans—as well as ecosystem disservices, which have negative effects on human communities. For example, through carbon sequestration, wetlands can perform ecosystem services of mitigating warming at a global scale and combating relative sea-level rise at a local scale, while generating food that supports regional food webs and fisheries. On the other hand, invasive aquatic vegetation (IAV) can trap sediment before it reaches wetlands, exacerbating local subsidence and relative sea-level rise while incurring great costs to recreation, fishing, and agencies tasked with its control. Effectively managing these ecosystem services and disservices requires understanding of how they are connected. For example, wetland restoration often creates opportunities for IAV, which may inhibit sediment deposition on the wetland and outcompete native species. As the Delta science community works toward a more integrative understanding of how different components of the Delta interact as a whole and across scales, the pervasive effects of the ecosystem services and disservices of primary producers serve as foundational knowledge.

Known drivers for the proliferation and intensification of HAB events include increasing nutrient pollution, climate change, regulation and modification of hydrological flow, and the combined effect of climate drivers and nutrient pollution. The San Francisco Bay–Delta system has largely been immune to severe or acute HAB events, but there is both a potential and realized threat which has been underestimated and under-reported, in part because of the lack of coordinated sampling and data reporting. There is also increasing evidence that HABs must be considered in the context of a freshwater-to-marine continuum, and that the physical and political boundaries separating components of the Bay–Delta system are porous barriers to HABs and their toxins. Much remains to be learned about the ecology and physiology of HAB organisms in this system, but five primary environmental drivers can be identified: temperature, salinity, irradiance, nutrients, and stratification/residence time. All these drivers are responding rapidly to climate change, but nutrients are the primary variable that is largely under human control. Plans for the development of a comprehensive monitoring, prediction, and mitigation strategy across the freshwater-to-marine continuum have been documented; effectively following through on these plans provides a roadmap toward identifying the drivers and threats—and reducing the potential consequences now and in the future. While HABs alone are not a sufficient motivator for potentially costly and extensive mitigation efforts, there is strong evidence that decreasing nutrient loads, maintaining hydrological connectivity while minimizing stagnant regions, and managing the biota to maintain biodiversity of the Bay–Delta system will result in multiple co-benefits, including reduction of the HAB threat potential.",Studies the ecology and physiology of harmful algal blooms and their environmental drivers in an aquatic system.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2023,20,4,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2023v20iss4art6,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1dz769db/qt1dz769db.pdf?t=rpuw6m,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,18,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

To assess whether augmented flow enhanced prey resources for Delta Smelt, we compared autumn zooplankton abundance, biomass, spatial distribution, and community composition in years when flow was augmented (2017, 2019) with reference years when flow was not augmented (2018, 2020). In augmented years, we detected higher total zooplankton abundance and altered community composition in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh. Increased freshwater in these regions was associated with higher abundance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, a preferred prey of Delta Smelt, while species associated with higher salinities—Acartiella sinensis and Tortanus dextrilobatus—were less abundant. Thus, autumn flow augmentations can influence foraging habitat and prey availability for Delta Smelt, underscoring the complex responses of estuarine zooplankton communities to changes in response to flow and salinity regimes. This study is management- relevant because it shows that important Delta Smelt prey items increase in downstream regions when X2 is lower. Whether that results in a response in Delta Smelt abundance remains to be seen.",Examines effects of flow augmentation on prey for endangered Delta Smelt.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2023,21,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2023v21iss2art1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1q21p670/qt1q21p670.pdf?t=rvzgbp,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,4,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,7,EXEC

Reduced food supply has been implicated in the Pelagic Organism Decline of the early 2000s, and further changes in zooplankton abundance, seasonality, and distribution may continue to threaten declining fishes. While we have a wealth of monitoring data, we know little about the abundance trends of many estuary zooplankton species. To fill these gaps, we reviewed past research and then examined trends in seasonality and abundance from 1972 to the present of three key but understudied zooplankton species (Bosmina longirostris, Acanthocyclops spp., and Acartiella sinensis) that play important roles in the estuary food web. We fit Bayesian generalized additive mixed models of each taxon’s relationship with salinity, seasonality, year, and geography on an integrated database of zooplankton monitoring in the upper estuary. We found marked changes in the seasonality and overall abundance of each study species. Bosmina longirostris no longer peaks in abundance in the fall months, Acanthocyclops spp. precipitously declined in all months and lost its strong relationship with salinity, and A. sinensis adult abundance has become more strongly related to salinity while juveniles have developed wider seasonal abundance peaks. Through these analyses, we have documented the relationship of each species with salinity and seasonality since the beginning of monitoring or their introduction, thus increasing our understanding of their ecology and importance in the estuary. These results can inform food-web models, be paired with fish data to model the contributions of these species toward fish abundance trends and be mirrored to elucidate other species’ trends in future studies.",Study of zooplankton population dynamics and their role in an aquatic ecosystem.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2023,21,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2023v21iss3art1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2b87w198/qt2b87w198.pdf?t=s1k1s0,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,6,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Rosemary Hartman,3,DISE

In 2017, the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s field office in Lodi implemented a two-stage verification process for Wakasagi to help prevent Delta Smelt from being mis-identified as Wakasagi. Under this process, Wakasagi are initially identified in the field, independently identified a second time by an experienced staff member in the laboratory, then stored on-site where they can be made available for future studies.

This study assessed data collected by long-term monitoring programs over the past 46 water years (1975-2021) to evaluate how water quality in the estuary changes during multi-year droughts. Data were aggregated by region (South-Central Delta, North Delta, Confluence, Suisun Bay, and Suisun Marsh) and season, then differences between multi-year Drought periods, multi-year Wet periods, and Neutral periods were compared using generalized linear models. We found that multi-year Drought periods altered multiple physical and chemical parameters in the estuary, increasing water temperature, salinity, water clarity, and nutrient levels. This trend was consistent across regions and seasons, with few exceptions. Increases in these parameters during Drought periods were likely caused by reduced Delta inflows that intensified in each successive dry year because of reduced precipitation and managed estuarine inflows and outflows. Drought periods did not substantially affect tidal velocities within the estuary, which remained mostly consistent across Wet and Drought periods. Trends in chlorophyll concentrations during Drought periods were more nuanced with higher concentrations occurring in the South-Central Delta region and during the winter and spring. Together, these results characterized drought in the estuary as warm, clear, high in nutrients, with patchy phytoplankton blooms (as indexed by chlorophyll), all of which have implications for higher trophic levels. Considering that droughts are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in California with climate change, understanding the effects of multi-year droughts on the water quality conditions of the estuary can help inform water management decisions.",Analyzes the impact of multi-year droughts on estuarine water quality parameters and lower trophic levels.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2024,22,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2024v22iss1art1,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1h7375k3/qt1h7375k3.pdf?t=sap8da,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,11,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,David Bosworth,1,DISE

Microcystis was detected throughout the Delta in all but the highest-flow years, and bloom incidence and severity increased during drier years. In the South Delta, Franks Tract, lower San Joaquin River, and Old River regions, where blooms are most prevalent, higher water temperatures and clarities combined with lower exports from state and federal water projects were the best explanatory factors for the occurrence of Microcystis blooms. Nutrient concentrations were lower in summer than in winter, but only became limiting at high phytoplankton concentrations. We used satellite data and in situ continuous monitoring of flow, phytoplankton communities, and water quality to track hydro-biogeochemical conditions during the 2021 case study Microcystis bloom in the Central Delta.

We investigated the population responses of these invasive species to dry years and their potential effects on the pelagic food web using data from the Interagency Ecological Program’s monitoring surveys. We found M. marginata rapidly moves upstream with changing salinities during dry years, though it sees its highest abundance during high-outflow years in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh. Grazing rates of M. marginata in the estuary have not been quantified but are potentially high during localized blooms. The two invasive clams overlap in distribution, but have opposite population responses to drought conditions, with increases in P. amurensis densities and decreases in C. fluminea densities in dry years. With increasing P. amurensis densities, the clams’ combined annual filtration rates increase during drier years in the confluence and Suisun Marsh. Like M. marginata, P. amurensis also shifts upstream during droughts, but because adults cannot move immediately with a change in salinity, the population center of distribution shifts upstream the year after a dry year as a result of juvenile recruitment. If multiple dry years occur in a row, and both P. amurensis and M. marginata move upstream together, their effects on the food web could be compounded, and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass could steeply decline in the confluence, affecting higher trophic levels in the estuary.",Focuses on the impact and population dynamics of aquatic invasive species in an estuary under drought conditions.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2024,22,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2024v22iss1art4,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7vp9554z/qt7vp9554z.pdf?t=sap8dm,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,4,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Rosemary Hartman,1,DISE

We also found that droughts increased water clarity, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll in the South Delta, zooplankton in the South Delta, and water residence time. Although our analyses only tested correlations, we hypothesized that most of the food-web responses could be traced to increased residence time, decreased transport rates, or both. However, some responses may have been caused by secondary effects, including shifts in salinity gradients, regional changes in water quality, or differences in top-down effects of increased predation and grazing rates.

Many, but not all, DAUCOs have relatively low total water supply variability compared to that of state-wide precipitation. Such low variability, in DAUCOs having sufficient diversity of water supply sources, is the result of switching between sources as needed to maintain a reliable total water supply. We used multiple approaches to explore these variations which involved four categories of water supply (local, groundwater, imported, and other) and two categories of water use (agricultural and urban). First, a cluster analysis of the volumetric water balance data identified a small set of clusters having similar magnitudes and proportions of water supply sources and water use—some of them composed of only a few DAUCOs but accounting for a disproportionate amount of the state’s water use. Second, a principal components analysis identified leading modes of anomalous water supply and water use among the 475 DAUCOs, capturing most of the time variation during 2002 to 2016. The most prominent mode exhibits a multi-year trend, most strongly involving increasing groundwater supply and agricultural water use, and decreasing urban water use and imported water supply. Over the study period, trends in both supply and use were pronounced, but differed considerably across California DAUCOs. One predominant subset of DAUCOs grew their agricultural water use with increased groundwater supply; in contrast to a widespread group of DAUCOs which reduced their urban water use. An important result for planners is our finding that variation in precipitation—itself important—is amplified by the human response to water supply availability and regulatory policy.","Analyzes spatial patterns of water supply and human water use, and the interplay with policy and variability.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2024,22,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2024v22iss2art2,https://escholarship.org/content/qt5v04j0xc/qt5v04j0xc.pdf?t=sf01kf,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,25,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Jennifer Stricklin,3,DOP

Particle routing at key junctions is based on well-established statistical models, and route-specific survival is calculated using the XT mean free-path length model. Behavioral parameters were estimated by fitting several competing models to a multiyear dataset of travel times from acoustic tagged juvenile salmon.

This chapter for the State of Bay–Delta Science report describes what drought means for the Delta, how drought is managed in the Delta, and how drought management has changed over time. Projections of future climate indicate the possibility of increased frequency and severity of droughts, which would increasingly affect California’s water system, society, and ecological functions within and beyond the Delta. California has experienced several major droughts in the 20th and 21st centuries, each of which has caused significant social and ecological effects, and has motivated improvements in water management. Droughts decrease native fish populations, increase harmful algal blooms, and promote the spread of many invasive plant and animal species. For people living within the Delta and those that rely on Delta water exports, droughts increase drinking water costs and decrease agricultural production, negatively affecting agricultural economies and labor markets. Tools developed in response to droughts include actions that increase supply (such as building water infrastructure), actions to reduce demand (such as water-conservation campaigns), and mitigation actions (such as monetary relief for drought-affected impacted communities. Improving drought resilience requires development of additional drought responses, increased forecasting accuracy, and increased awareness of effects on vulnerable communities and ecosystems. Even with development of additional management actions, strategies, and regulations, meeting the current levels of demand for water will likely be difficult. Drought conditions already cause conflict between human and environmental uses, and—with more extreme droughts possible in the future and projected increases in demand—providing for all users’ needs, even with major changes to water management in the Delta, will be challenging.","Focuses on drought impacts, management, and adaptation strategies in response to climate change.",San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2025,23,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2025v23iss1art3,,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Several native fish species will likely decline, while a considerable number of non-native and cosmopolitan species tolerant of high temperatures are predicted to be relatively unaffected by or even benefit from a warmer climate. For humans, high temperatures and heatwaves are associated with wide-ranging health effects, from direct effects such as dehydration and heat exhaustion, to indirect and adverse health outcomes such as lower birth weight, mental health problems, and violence. These health effects will be exacerbated by ecosystem changes, as a longer warm season will increase our exposure to vectors such as mosquitos, as well as to the toxins produced by harmful algal blooms. Climate change is a global issue that cannot be resolved effectively at a regional level; however, some actions can either be taken or further studied to potentially lessen the effects of rising temperatures for the estuary’s ecosystem and residents at a more localized level. Although decreasing global greenhouse gas emissions remains our best option to combat climate change and the resultant temperature increases, successful adaptation to warming and heatwaves will require actions at multiple scales.",Examines the interactive effects of rising temperatures on an estuary ecosystem and human health.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2025,23,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2025v23iss1art4,,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Our goals were to describe spatial and seasonal patterns in water temperature across the upper estuary, and evaluate how temperature stress and suitability vary across the aquatic ecosystem. We synthesized 10 years of continuous water-temperature data at 75 stations across six regions of the estuary between 2010 and 2019. We identified stressful temperature thresholds for species of interest using published physiological limits and observed distribution, including Endangered Species Act-listed native fish (e.g., osmerids, salmonids), native fish (e.g., cyprinids), non-native fish (e.g., centrarchids, bivalves), and nuisance species such as invasive aquatic vegetation, and harmful cyanobacteria. We then quantified thermal stress across varying spatial and temporal scales and metrics. Analyses indicated there were detectable regional temperature differences, and that Suisun Bay was the only region to provide regular thermal refuge during the warmer parts of the year, though portions of the confluence and Suisun Marsh also provided potential thermal refuge during summer/fall and during cooler parts of the day. Meanwhile, the Central and South Delta experienced the warmest temperatures, exceeding thresholds for listed species throughout summer and early fall. We found that listed species such as juvenile salmonids and osmerids experience more thermal stress across a number of metrics. Fishes with higher heat tolerance (including non-natives and select natives), aquatic vegetation, and Microcystis (a harmful cyanobacteria) had the lowest average number of thermal stress days. This study demonstrates that the estuary is already exhibiting stressful conditions for species of concern, and thermal stress will only increase with climate change. We identify at what times of year and where the estuary may provide refuge from thermal stress conditions across a variety of species, which has important implications for restoration prioritization, design, and species management.",Examines the impact of thermal stress on aquatic species in an estuarine ecosystem.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2025,23,2,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2025v23iss2art3,,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

In this study, we examined how differing hydrologic conditions influence the run composition of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the floodplain (Yolo Bypass) vs. the mainstem of the Sacramento River. Juvenile Chinook Salmon from the Yolo Bypass and areas along the Sacramento River were identified to the genetically distinct runs (fall, late-fall, winter, and spring) from 2013 to 2019. We found overwhelmingly that length-at-date methods are misclassifying fish, particularly late-fall- and spring-run fish, and winter-run fish in the bypass. Using this genetic run-timing, we found that the abundances of endangered runs (spring and winter) are reduced during low flow periods in both the bypass and Sacramento River. Even during drought conditions, juvenile Chinook Salmon rearing in the Yolo Bypass attained significantly larger sizes than those in the Sacramento River. When comparing fish growth across time, during wet years fish in the bypass start smaller and get significantly larger over the course of the year, compared to drought years; while during both wet and dry years fish in the Sacramento River largely attain a smaller size than the Yolo Bypass fish.

In order to determine whether these snakes actively select their prey or simply consume what is abundant, we examined prey selection by adult Giant Gartersnakes in the context of what prey was available to each individual. Giant Gartersnakes selected a native anuran over nonnative anuran and fish species despite these nonnatives dominating the available species composition.

We extend that path modeling framework to account for systematic variations of anelastic attenuation for ten physiographic subregions in California that are defined in consideration of geological differences. Using a large database that is approximately doubled in size for California relative to Next Generation Attenuation (NGA)-West2, we find relatively high attenuation in Coast Range areas (North Coast, Bay area, and Central Coast), relatively low attenuation in eastern California (Sierra Nevada, eastern California shear zone), and state-average attenuation elsewhere, including southern California. As part of these analyses, we find for the North Coast region relatively weak ground motions on average from induced events (from the Geysers), similar attenuation rates for induced and tectonic events, and higher levels of ground-motion dispersion than other portions of the state.

New high-resolution lidar elevation data combined with nine infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) ages of discrete geomorphic surfaces that are bounded by prominent transverse wind and river gaps allow for investigation of tectonic topography through time. Luminescence ages from four of the six surfaces yield depositional ages that range from 32 ka to 153 ka, which are broadly consistent with a previously published soil chronosequence. Our graphical modeling indicates an average surface uplift rate of ~2.1 mm/yr and an average along-strike fold propagation rate of ~20 mm/yr. However, our probabilistic modelling and topographic analysis suggest a rate decrease of both uplift and lateral propagation toward the fault tip from ~2.4 to 0.7 mm/yr and from ~49 to 14 mm/yr, respectively. Rate decreases are not progressive but rather occur in punctuated deformational intervals across previously documented structural barriers (tear faults) resulting in a fold that is characterized by discrete segments that exhibit a systematic deformational decrease toward the east. The punctuated tectonic growth of Wheeler Ridge has also locally controlled the topographic evolution of the anticline by effecting the formational timing and position of at least seven wind and river gaps that result from multiple north-flowing antecedent streams that traverse the growing structure. We quantify the timing of wind and river gap formation, based on IRSL results and inferred incision rates, and present a model for the spatiotemporal evolution of transverse drainages and the topographic development of Wheeler Ridge. Our chronology of gap formation broadly correlates with regional Late Pleistocene dry climate intervals suggesting that both tectonics and climate were integral to the geomorphic development of the Wheeler Ridge anticline.","Studies tectonic deformation, landscape evolution, and geomorphic processes of an anticline.",Lithosphere,2021,2021,Special 2,GeoScienceWorld,https://doi.org/10.2113/2021/3395719,https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article-pdf/doi/10.2113/2021/3395719/5451681/3395719.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,9,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Regression tree analysis between observed depletion slopes and physiography, particularly vegetation height and terrain roughness, displays clear nonlinear dynamics and explains 31% of the variance in depletion slope.

These soils are characteristically soft with shear wave velocities (VS) as low as 20 m/s and thicknesses as great as 12 m. These unusually soft site conditions produce significant site response effects that are not reliably predicted using existing ergodic site amplification models. To develop a region-specific site response model that captures the unique behaviors of peaty organic soils in the Delta, accurate site characterization is needed. This paper presents site characterization data with emphasis on near-surface VS profiles collected across the Delta and develops two region-specific VS-related models. The first is a regionally calibrated model to predict the time-averaged shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m (VS30), which is a common input parameter to ergodic site amplification models, conditioned on peat thickness (tp). Peat thickness has been mapped throughout the Delta and is, therefore, a useful proxy for VS30. This VS30 proxy model significantly reduces bias and uncertainty compared with existing proxy-based models not calibrated for peaty soils. The second model, also dependent on peat thickness, was developed to extrapolate relatively shallow VS profiles to deeper and firmer reference conditions for use in ground response analyses and other applications. Results of ground response analyses for a deep and truncated-and-extrapolated VS profile are used to verify the effectiveness of the extrapolation model.

Thus, this study aimed to compare the trophic ecology of these species off the southern coast of Angola during the austral summer and winter, by determining their diet composition and overlap, feeding strategies, trophic positions, and evaluating the correlation between their feeding intensity and remote-derived chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature. The results demonstarte that both species are generalists and ingest a wide range of protistoplankton and metazooplankton taxa of distinct sizes. Both sardinellas show high flexibility and adaptability to prey availability, using both filter-feeding and particulate-feeding modes. The diets were dominated by diatoms and calanoid copepods in terms of relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence, respectively, in the stomach contents. Tintinnid ciliates, fish eggs, decapod larvae, euphausiids, cladocerans and cnidarians had high wet weight contributions. The diets overlapped by 64% overall, indicating moderate competition for food, with S. maderensis exhibiting a lower trophic position than S. aurita (2.98 versus 3.49). The feeding intensity of S. maderensis was positively correlated with Chl-a, and moderately negatively correlated with SST, suggesting that species is more influenced by environmental variables owing to its lower trophic position. Trophic interactions between the two species appear to be mediated by prey sizes and availability. These findings demonstate the value of satellite-derived data as proxies to estimate the feeding intensity of these species, which will be useful to formulate regional ecological models or to predict the stock trends of S. maderensis in particular.","Study of marine fish trophic interactions, diet, and their relationship with environmental factors.",African Journal of Marine Science,2025,47,2,National Inquiry Services Center (NISC),https://doi.org/10.2989/1814232x.2025.2526117,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Pedro Morais,2,DISE

One element of DWR's and the Bureau of Reclamation's Environmental Monitoring Program—the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) program—examines the spatial and temporal extent of C. fluminea and P. amurensis control on phytoplankton. Historically, the GRTS program sampled 175 benthic stations (50 stations that are monitored every year and 125 randomly selected new stations that are changed yearly) throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and northern San Francisco Bay (San Pablo and Suisun Bays) during one week in May and October. In 2019, only the 50 annually replicated stations were sampled.Corbicula fluminea and P. amurensis biomass and grazing rates had similar trends; therefore, the conclusions regarding biomass are applied to grazing rate data as well.

Although C. fluminea's average biomass was lower in October (10 gAFDM/m2) than in May (20 gAFDM/m2), the highest single biomass value was also observed in October (300 gAFDM/m2). In both May and October, most stations that recorded high C. fluminea biomass values were located in the deep water (≥3 m of depth between the surface of the water and the surface of the substrate on the bottom) and were sampled in either rivers or sloughs. A relation between depth and biomass was not observed for P. amurensis.Both C. fluminea and P. amurensis recruitment (recruits are considered animals ≤2.5mm in length in this study and recruitment is the process of recruits successfully settled to the bottom) increased from May to October.

The improvement of the various water-balance components targeted the actual evapotranspiration component, which, in turn, reduced the uncertainty of the recharge estimate. The improvement of this component was enabled by the availability of a national, gridded actual-evapotranspiration product from the U.S. Geological Survey that was unique in its scope to combine remotely sensed spatial variability and ground-based long-term water-balance constraints. This dataset provided the ability to assess monthly actual evapotranspiration for 62 vegetation types and to perform regional calibration in watersheds throughout California with the objective of closing the water balance using improved estimates for each component. The refinements, including vegetation-specific evapotranspiration, enabled the development of applications that could explore various aspects of landscape disturbance, such as wildfire, forest management, or urbanization.

In the San Francisco Estuary, the threatened longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys spawns adhesive eggs in fresh to brackish water. Attached eggs hatch and the larvae disperse seaward toward higher-salinity water. Actual locations of spawning and hatching are unknown, and cannot reliably be inferred from distributions of larvae because intense tidal mixing obscures the history of movement. Human interventions such as manipulations and diversions of freshwater flow may contribute to the ongoing decline of this species, and these effects depend on where the fish hatch. We combined movement estimated using hydrodynamic and particle-tracking modeling with trawl data using a Bayesian model to estimate the location and timing of hatching, as well as natural mortality of larvae and losses to freshwater diversions. Results indicate that longfin smelt may hatch further seaward than previously believed, and that estimated direct losses due to diversions were small relative to other sources of mortality. Abundance of this species varies ~100-fold with freshwater flow, but our results suggest that proportional entrainment was practically zero during an extreme wet year and relatively low (2%) in a moderately dry year. This method could be applied to other estuarine and coastal systems where strong mixing reduces the ability of simpler models to predict hatching locations and larval movements.",Analyzing longfin smelt larval distribution and mortality in relation to freshwater flow for conservation.,Marine Ecology Progress Series,2022,700,,Inter-Research Science Center,https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14168,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,6,EXEC

A mismatch between data, data systems, and data needs for decision making can result in inefficient and inequitable capital investments, resource allocations, environmental protection, hazard mitigation, and quality of life. In this paper, we examine the relationship between data and decision making in environmental management, with a focus on water management. We focus on the concept of decision-driven data systems —data systems that incorporate an assessment of decision-makers' data needs into their design. The aim of the research was to examine the process of translating data into effective decision making by engaging stakeholders in the development of a water data system. Using California's legislative mandate for state agencies to integrate existing water and other environmental data as a case study, we developed and applied a participatory approach to inform data-system design and identify unmet data needs. Using workshops and focused stakeholder meetings, we developed 20 diverse use cases to assess data sources, availability, characteristics, gaps, and other attributes of data used for representative decisions. Federal and state agencies made up about 90% of the data sources, and could readily adapt to a federated data system, our recommended model for the state. The remaining 10% of more-specialized data, central to important decisions across multiple use cases, would require additional investment or incentives to achieve data consistency, interoperability, and compatibility with a federated system. Based on this assessment, we propose a typology of different types of data limitations and gaps described by stakeholders. We also propose technical, governance, and stakeholder engagement evaluation criteria to guide planning and building environmental data systems. Data-system governance involving both producers and users of data was seen as essential to achieving workable standards, stable funding, convenient data availability, resilience to institutional change, and long-term buy-in by stakeholders.

This study examined degradation of cattail (Typha spp) and tule (Schoenoplectus acutus) litters in restored wetlands through the lens of lignin, a major structural biopolymer in vascular plants with degradation characteristics very sensitive to oxic vs. anoxic conditions. A series of litterbags were deployed during the first 10 years after flooding of Deep (55 cm) and Shallow (25 cm) restored wetlands. As emergent marsh vegetation spread through the maturing wetlands, anoxic conditions were more prevalent and overall degradation rates of litter in litterbags were lower. In later experiments in the maturing wetlands, lignin was progressively enriched in litter as evidenced by carbon-normalized yields (8) that increased in tule starting materials from 6.3 to 7.1 mg 100mgOC-1 to as high as 9.9 mg 100mgOC-1, and in cattail starting materials from 5.9 to 7.0 mg 100mgOC-1 to as high as 10.9 mg 100mgOC-1. However, in an experiment initiated soon after the restored wetlands were constructed, 8 in tule litter decreased from 6.8 to 3.6 mg 100mgOC-1, highlighting the prevalence of initial oxic conditions. With the exception of the early oxic conditions for tule there was an overall trend of decreasing lignin acid-to-aldehyde ratios with litter degradation, which runs counter to most studies in the literature. We hypothesize that this reflects the utilization of more oxygen-rich lignin components as electron acceptors in redox reactions. No consistent differences were observed in degradation patterns between the Shallow and Deep wetlands. There were distinct differences in lignin degradation in cattail (more resistant) vs. tule (less resistant), which indicates that although anoxia may be the dominant control on organic matter accretion in wetlands, specific types of vegetation in restored or constructed wetlands affects organic matter preservation, and hence accretion. Thus, selective management of predominant species in wetlands may prove important for the ability of wetlands to maintain emergent vegetation during sea-level rise and to preserve the overall stability of wetland soils.",Study of plant litter degradation in restored wetlands for ecosystem resilience.,Frontiers in Environmental Science,2020,8,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.564603,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2020.564603/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in a variety of natural and human-influenced environments and have been found to be time- and cost-efficient, but have not yet been widely applied to restoration contexts. In this study, we evaluated the utility of UAVs as an innovative tool for monitoring tidal marsh restoration. We first optimized methods for creating high-resolution orthomosaics and Structure from Motion digital elevation models from UAV imagery by conducting experiments to determine an optimal density of ground control points (GCPs) and flight altitude for UAV monitoring of topography and new vegetation. We used elevation models and raw and classified orthomosaics before, during, and after construction of the restoration site to communicate with various audiences and inform adaptive management. We found that we could achieve 1.1 cm vertical accuracy in our elevation models using 2.1 GCPs per hectare at a flight altitude of 50 m. A lower flight altitude of 30 m was more ideal for capturing patchy early plant cover while still being efficient enough to cover the entire 25-hectare site. UAV products were valuable for several monitoring applications, including calculating the volume of soil moved during construction, tracking whether elevation targets were achieved, quantifying and examining the patterns of vegetation development, and monitoring topographic change including subsidence, erosion, and creek development. We found UAV monitoring advantageous for the ability to survey areas difficult to access on foot, capture spatial variation, tailor timing of data collection to research needs, and collect a large amount of accurate data rapidly at relatively low cost, though with some compromise in detail compared with field monitoring. In summary, we found that UAV data informed the planning, implementation and monitoring phases of a major landscape restoration project and could be valuable for restoration in many habitats.",The article focuses on using UAVs to monitor and inform tidal marsh restoration efforts.,Frontiers in Environmental Science,2021,9,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.642906,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2021.642906/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,24,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Structural measures tend to be rigid and not easily adapted to increased flooding regimes resulting from environmental change. Such actions also limit the natural hydrologic benefits of floodplains such as storing floodwaters, improving water quality, providing habitat for invertebrates and fish during periods of inundation, and supporting a multitude of cultural services. As these benefits are more widely recognized, policies are being adopted to encourage projects that reduce flood risks and restore floodplain ecosystems, while acknowledging the social-ecological context. The number of such projects, however, remains small. We assessed four multi-benefit floodplain projects (two in California, United States, and two in Germany) and characterized their drivers, history, and measures implemented. In both United States cases, the dominant driver behind the project was flood risk reduction, and ecosystem restoration followed, in one case inadvertently, in the other as a requirement to receive a subsidy for a flood risk reduction project. One German case was motivated by ecosystem restoration, but it was more widely accepted because it also offered flood management benefits. The fourth case was conceived in terms of balanced goals of flood risk reduction, ecosystem restoration, and recreation.

These systems are characterized by scarce water and often sparsely vegetated lands where ecological adaptation to arid conditions has its underpinnings in the universal dependency on water to support life. Understanding the ecohydrological similarity of springs in water-limited areas requires integration of multiple lines of evidence from diverse disciplines. A unique dataset of hydrological and ecological characteristics of Mojave and Sonoran Desert spring ecosystems in California has been developed, incorporating a wide range of spring conditions that enables a broad evaluation of similarity in ecohydrological characteristics across springs in the region. The lack of observed correlation between hydrologic and ecological parameters suggests that the springs in the California Desert each represent a somewhat unique ecosystem that has developed in relative isolation from the other springs. These results imply that because of the uniqueness of these desert ecosystems the idea of mitigation compensation or mitigation offset via replacement or substitution can never truly be achieved if/when these spring areas are impacted. Any ecosystem used as a replacement or substitution could not reasonably be expected to be similar in terms of the associated hydrologic and ecologic conditions to the ecosystem lost.

Habitat selection analysis and functional responses can be used to develop strategies to avoid habitat limitations, guide habitat management, and set attainable conservation goals. GPS relocations of marked animals are the principal data used in habitat selection analysis. The accuracy and frequency with which tracking devices collect data are increasing and may result in non-stationary point processes that result from latent behaviors previously unidentifiable in sparse data. Methods We investigated non-stationary step length distributions and integrated a two-mixture model of animal movement with step selection analysis to identify patterns of activity among four species of co-occurring waterfowl that winter in the Central Valley of California, United States. We evaluated relative strength of selection and compared functional responses across a range of habitat types for two goose and two dabbling duck species. Results Goose species (greater white-fronted goose [ Anser albifrons ] and lesser snow goose [ Anser caerulescens caerulescens ]) used habitats similarly and displayed similar functional responses with habitat availability. Northern pintail ( Anas acuta ) displayed functional responses for habitats that provided primary food resources and sanctuary from hunting that were more similar to geese than to mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ), which expressed a more generalist pattern of habitat selection. Discussion Our results define conditions where food resource competition between geese and ducks could operate, which indicate that some species may be more impacted than others. Specifically, early season food limitation may manifest more strongly in snow geese due to longer movements and stronger functional response with rice availability. Late season limitations may manifest in northern pintail, which remain reliant on rice later but may not be reflected in habitat selection patterns due to a consistent functional response with rice availability. We show that multiple movement processes present in high-resolution data can be used to obtain a variety of information about animal behavior and that subsequent step selection analyses may demonstrate unique functional responses relative to alternate habitat selection methods that warrant additional investigation.","Study of waterfowl movement, habitat selection, and ecology.",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2023,11,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1232704,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.1232704/pdf?isPublishedV2=False,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In rivers, fish frequently change their orientation even when stimuli are unchanged, which makes understanding and predicting their movement in time-varying environments near built infrastructure particularly challenging. Cognition is central to fish movement, and our lack of understanding is costly in terms of time and resources needed to design and manage water operations infrastructure that is able to meet the multiple needs of human society while preserving valuable living resources. An open question is how best to cognitively account for the multi-modal, -attribute, -alternative, and context-dependent decision-making of fish near infrastructure. Here, we leverage agent- and individual-based modeling techniques to encode a cognitive approach to mechanistic fish movement behavior that operates at the scale in which water operations river infrastructure is engineered and managed. Our cognitive approach to mechanistic behavior modeling uses a Eulerian-Lagrangian-agent method (ELAM) to interpret and quantitatively predict fish movement and passage/entrainment near infrastructure across different and time-varying river conditions. A goal of our methodology is to leverage theory and equations that can provide an interpretable version of animal movement behavior in complex environments that requires a minimal number of parameters in order to facilitate the application to new data in real-world engineering and management design projects. We first describe concepts, theory, and mathematics applicable to animals across aquatic, terrestrial, avian, and subterranean domains. Then, we detail our application to juvenile Pacific salmonids in the Bay-Delta of California. We reproduce observations of salmon movement and passage/entrainment with one field season of measurements, year 2009, using five simulated behavior responses to 3-D hydrodynamics. Then, using the ELAM model calibrated from year 2009 data, we predict the movement and passage/entrainment of salmon for a later field season, year 2014, which included a novel engineered fish guidance boom not present in 2009. Central to the fish behavior model’s performance is the notion that individuals are attuned to more than one hydrodynamic signal and more than one timescale. We find that multi-timescale perception can disentangle multiplex hydrodynamic signals and inform the context-based behavioral choice of a fish. Simulated fish make movement decisions within a rapidly changing environment without global information, knowledge of which direction is downriver/upriver, or path integration. The key hydrodynamic stimuli are water speed, the spatial gradient in water speed, water acceleration, and fish swim bladder pressure. We find that selective tidal stream transport in the Bay-Delta is a superset of the fish-hydrodynamic behavior repertoire that reproduces salmon movement and passage in dam reservoir environments. From a cognitive movement ecology perspective, we describe how a behavior can emerge from a repertoire of multiple fish-hydrodynamic responses that are each tailored to suit the animal’s recent past experience (localized environmental context). From a movement behavior perspective, we describe how different fish swim paths can emerge from the same local hydrodynamic stimuli. Our findings demonstrate that a cognitive approach to mechanistic fish movement behavior modeling does not always require the maximum possible spatiotemporal resolution for representing the river environmental stimuli although there are concomitant tradeoffs in resolving features at different scales. From a water operations perspective, we show that a decision-support tool can successfully operate outside the calibration conditions, which is a necessary attribute for tools informing future engineering design and management actions in a world that will invariably look different than the past.",Develops a predictive model for fish movement to inform the design and management of water operations infrastructure.,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2023,11,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.703946,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.703946/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,16,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Jacob McQuirk,5,O&M

We compared the response of two headwater catchments at the rain-snow-transition elevation in the wetter central Sierra and more water-limited southern Sierra. The variability of precipitation exerted a greater influence on annual evapotranspiration and runoff than vegetation changes from operational fuels treatment or historical wildfire. The short-term impacts of vegetation changes associated with wildfire, however, did have a greater effect on evapotranspiration and runoff than temperature increases in a warming climate. The average central-Sierra headwater response of evapotranspiration and runoff to fuels treatments (-12%, +12%, respectively) and wildfire (-43%, +46%) were greater than the projected responses to a 4.5oC temperature increase (+2% and -7%). The response in the southern Sierra was limited by lower annual precipitation and showed no response to fuels treatments; but the catchment showed respective changes of -11% and +17% in evapotranspiration and runoff for wildfire, versus +9% and -3% to a 4.5oC temperature increase. These results suggest that in the central Sierra, reductions in vegetation from either fuels treatments or historical wildfire can, temporarily, offset reductions in streamflow from a warming climate. In the southern Sierra, impacts of fuels treatments were small, and only more-extensive vegetation removal as would occur with wildfire, results in significant changes in hydrologic fluxes. Further research is needed to investigate how initial hydrologic changes and climate effects evolve as vegetation adapts and regrows following disturbance.","Study of hydrologic response to vegetation changes, wildfire, and climate warming in catchments.",Frontiers in Forests and Global Change,2020,3,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2020.539429,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.539429/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In particular, we aimed to examine if San Francisco Bay (a global hotspot for non-native species richness) differed in composition and space occupation, especially since open space can facilitate colonization. Additionally, we explored how biogeography, assembly and succession dynamics over the short and long term, and space availability affect marine communities across broad spatial scales. Patterns of community assembly differed among bays, with more bare space and less secondary cover (species settling on species) in San Francisco Bay. San Francisco Bay was also distinguished by a higher percent cover of Tunicata (almost all of which are non-native and historically absent) over multiple time scales. Cirripedia recruited on bare panels in all three Bays but cover increased only in Tampa Bay, as soak time increased.

This paper provides the first observationally based investigation of the spatio-temporal variability of the SFBP, using a plume tracking algorithm applied to more than two decades (2002-2023) of ocean color data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard satellites Aqua and Terra. The turbid SFBP spreads radially, extending 10-20 km offshore around 50% of the time, and during extreme discharge events (&amp;lt;1% of the time), the plume can reach nearly 60 km offshore to the shelf break. The greatest variability in frequency of plume occurrence was observed 10-20 km offshore and it was largely explained by the seasonal cycle (80% of total variance), linked primarily to seasonal changes in river discharge. Largest plume areas (determined by summing up all pixel areas weighted by their respective fraction of plume occurrence) were observed during winter and smallest during summer, occupying on average 24% and 1.5% of GoF area, respectively. Beyond 20-30 km offshore, variability in frequency of plume occurrence was dominated by the intraseasonal band (50-80% of total variance), attributed to plume response to synoptic wind-forcing and/or filaments and eddies, while the interannual band played a secondary role in the plume variability (&amp;lt;20% of total variance). Finally, a multivariable linear regression model of the turbid SFBP area was created to explore the potential predictability of the plume’s influence in the GoF. The model included the annual and semi-annual cycles and discharge anomalies (deseasoned and detrended), and despite its simplicity, it explained over 78% of total variance of the turbid SFBP area. Therefore, it could be a useful tool for scientists and stakeholders to better understand how management actions on freshwater supply can have consequences offshore beyond the Golden Gate and help guide future management decisions in this ecologically important region.",Study of the spatio-temporal dynamics and distribution of an estuarine plume influenced by river discharge and environmental factors.,Frontiers in Marine Science,2025,12,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1588441,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2025.1588441/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Five years of field data collected from stations across the freshwater reaches of the estuary were used to identify the plankton communities that covaried with Microcystis blooms, including non-photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic genera using a suite of analyses, including microscopy, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and shotgun metagenomic analysis. Coherence between the abundance of Microcystis and members of the plankton community was determined by hierarchal cluster analysis (CLUSTER) and type 3 similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF), as well as correlation analysis. Microcystis abundance varied with many cyanobacteria and phytoplankton genera and was most closely correlated with the non-toxic cyanobacterium Merismopoedia , the green algae Monoraphidium and Chlamydomonas , and the potentially toxic cyanobacteria Pseudoanabaena , Dolichospermum , Planktothrix , Sphaerospermopsis , and Aphanizomenon . Among non-photosynthetic bacteria, the xenobiotic bacterium Phenylobacterium was the most closely correlated with Microcystis abundance. The coherence of DNA sequences for phyla across trophic levels in the plankton community also demonstrated the decrease in large zooplankton and increase in small zooplankton during blooms. The breadth of correlations between Microcystis and plankton across trophic levels suggests Microcystis influences ecosystem production through bottom-up control during blooms.

On this basis, the paper then engages with the public policy theory literature on lesson-drawing to assess the potential for policy learning for these specific contexts and other countries.

Cowen,Cornell University,,geological and earth sciences,hydrology,0.95,"The use of image based velocimetry methods for field-scale measurements of river surface flow and river discharge have become increasingly widespread in recent years, as these methods have several advantages over more traditional methods. In particular, image based methods are able to measure over large spatial areas at the surface of the flow at high spatial and temporal resolution without requiring physical contact with the water. However, there is a lack of tools to understand the spatial uncertainty in these methods and, in particular, the sensitivity of the uncertainty to parameters under the implementer's control. We present a tool specifically developed to assess spatial uncertainty in remotely sensed, obliquely captured, quantitative images, used in surface velocimetry techniques, and selected results from some of our measurements as an illustration of the tool's capabilities. The developed software is freely available via the public repository GitHub. Uncertainty exists in the coordinate transformation between pixel array coordinates (2D) and physical coordinates (3D) because of the uncertainty related to each of the inputs to the calculation of this transformation, and additionally since the transformation itself is generally calculated in a least squares sense from an over determined system of equations. In order to estimate the uncertainty of the transformation, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation, in which we perturb the inputs to the algorithm used to find the coordinate transformation, and observe the effect on the results of transformations between pixel- and physical- coordinates. This perturbation is performed independently a large number of times over a range of the input parameter space, creating a set of inputs to the coordinate transformation calculation, which are used to calculate a coordinate transformation, and predict the physical coordinates of each pixel in the image. We analyze the variance of the physical position corresponding to each pixel location across the set of transformations, and quantify the sensitivity of the transformation to changes in each of the inputs across the field of view. We also investigate the impact on uncertainty of ground control point (GCP) location and number, and quantify spatial change in uncertainty, which is the key parameter for calculating uncertainty in velocity measurements, in addition to positions. This tool may be used to plan field deployments, allowing the user to optimize the number and distribution of GCPs, the accuracy with which their position must be determined, and the camera placement required to achieve a target level of spatial uncertainty. It can also be used to estimate the uncertainty in image-based velocimetry measurements, including how this uncertainty varies over space within the field of view.",Develops a method to analyze spatial uncertainty in image-based measurements of river surface flow and discharge.,Frontiers in Water,2022,4,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.744278,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2022.744278/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,9,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Its problems exemplify those of many urban communities built near riverine and deltaic systems, that are subject to climate change. The city and its surrounding communities are protected by an elaborate system of levees and flood bypasses; but aging infrastructure, expected increases in extreme wet weather, and projected sea level rise are increasing the risk of levee failures. We explore how flood management approaches including social/institutional (non-structural), traditional structural, and ecological based approaches are being implemented in the Lower Sacramento/North Delta Region amid significant obstacles, to build resilient flood management systems. We review four case studies, one structural levee project and three multi-benefit projects that are only recently being implemented. We also examine the barriers, constraints, and challenges for implementing flood protection projects, and how project proponents are collectively working through these obstacles. We conclude that significant progress has been made in building flood resiliency since the 2008 Central Valley Flood Protection Act and the release of the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan. Informational tools and policies are being developed to educate the public and prepare for floods. Structural levee investments are substantial and are being implemented through partnerships. Statewide policies and investments are increasingly supporting multi-benefit projects that incorporate ecological restoration/enhancement while expanding flood volume capacity. Progress on implementing multi-benefit projects has been slow, due to land acquisition, easements, funding, regulatory and construction challenges; however, solutions to these impediments are emerging to facilitate more rapid progress.

In semi-arid regions, particularly, both increased flooding and prolonged droughts pose a threat as the water resources system must be prepared for both types of extremes. To understand how future extremes may be altered, however, past extremes must be understood. For this reason, this study employs three physically based models to simulate the atmospheric, snow, and hydrologic conditions in the American River Watershed: the Weather Research and Forecasting Model and the Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro-Climate Model with the addition of a SNOW Module. Each model is individually calibrated and validated against either gauge data or data provided by the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model for two 10-year periods before a full 169-year daily reconstruction is performed for the period from 1852 through 2020.

The reconstruction outputs are found to successfully simulate historical conditions at both daily and monthly scales. Results highlight the importance of fully accounting for the role of temperature in snow processes and the subsequent flow conditions. By understanding how the models perform under historical extreme conditions, future extreme events can be compared, and necessary adaptation plans can be conceived to ensure that the watershed is prepared for future wet and dry conditions. Additionally, the created reconstruction dataset is comprehensive, simulating conditions across the hydroclimate, at a finer spatial and temporal scale than is typically available from observation data alone.

California’s water management sectors face an increased risk from climate change, and consequently the California Department of Water Resources has investigated the benefits of using floodwater for managed aquifer recharge (Flood-MAR). Flood-MAR requires the implementation of an integrated surface-ground water resources approach that can address watershed hydrologic processes from the atmosphere to the valley floor and the aquifer systems. In this process, it was learned that there is a need to develop a root-zone model with the capability of determining both the amount and the frequency of the applied water at field scale using crop and soil data to avoid damaging agricultural crops. Therefore, the following factors were considered: soil suitability, crop suitability, and soil oxygen depletion due to the application of water available for recharge. IDC (Integrated Demand Calculator) is a stand-alone root zone component of the Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) which provides conceptual features for simulating root zone saturation levels. We propose a simple conceptual root-zone model to calculate the application amount and frequency of water available for recharge through the implementation of Flood-MAR operations on agricultural fields. The method is based on soil-land use combination, and crop saturation tolerance considering seasonal patterns during a long-term application of water available for recharge.

To recover and conserve this species, a captive culture program was initiated, focusing on the collection, captive rearing and breeding of wild broodstock, and the rearing of their offspring. Although progress has been made in the collection of broodstock and the production and culturing of larvae, no studies have evaluated the rearing of juvenile life stages in captivity. The present study examines methodological considerations for culturing F1 juvenile longfin smelt, specifically, the first efforts toward weaning juveniles to a dry commercial pellet feed. Cultured juvenile longfin smelt were fed live Artemia only or co-fed Artemia and dry feed for 62 days, and the effects of feed type on juvenile survival, growth, body condition, and fatty acid profiles were examined. No significant differences were observed between feeding treatments, despite an 80% reduction in Artemia in the co-feeding treatment. Furthermore, examination of fish stomach contents at the end of the trial confirmed the transition to dry feed. This is the first study to indicate successful feeding by longfin smelt on dry commercial pellets, and suggests that juvenile longfin smelt can be fully weaned onto dry feeds. Results of this study are critical for closing the lifecycle of longfin smelt in captivity and developing a successful conservation culture program for this imperiled species.","Study of captive rearing and feeding for the conservation of a threatened fish species, supporting fisheries management.",Animals,2022,12,12,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12121478,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/12/1478/pdf?version=1654658716,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,4,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

High vertical resolution RO profiles could be useful to observe atmospheric rivers (ARs) over the ocean, which transport water vapor in shallow, elongated corridors that frequently impact the west coasts of continents. The multi-year AR Reconnaissance campaign has extensively sampled ARs over the northeastern Pacific with dropsondes, providing an invaluable dataset to evaluate the reliability of RO retrievals. These dropsondes, and a reanalysis product that assimilates them, are compared to three RO datasets: (1) established operational missions, (2) COSMIC-2, and (3) the commercial Spire constellation. Each RO dataset has biases relative to reanalyses of less than 0.5% N in the upper troposphere and negative biases in the lower troposphere. Direct colocations with dropsondes indicate that vertical refractivity gradients present within ARs may be contributing to negative biases at higher altitudes inside than outside ARs, where the greatest variability and vertical gradients are at the well-defined boundary layer top. Observations from Spire are overly smooth, affecting the ability to resolve the low-level structure of an AR. Surprisingly, the depth of penetration into the lower troposphere is greater inside an AR than outside for all datasets.

The study employs operative climate model projections from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Specifically, 64 individual downscaled daily projections (1/16 degree, approximately 6 by 6 km) on precipitation and temperature from 32 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) from 2020–2099 are utilized for the analysis. The results indicate increasing warming (in mean, minimum, and maximum temperature) further into the future under both emission scenarios. Warming also exhibits a strong seasonality, with winters expecting lower and summers expecting higher increases in temperature. In contrast, for mean annual total precipitation, there is no consistent wetter or drier signal. On average, the changes in annual total precipitation are minimal. However, dry season precipitation is projected to decline. The study also shows that the number of wet days is projected to decrease while the number of very wet (daily precipitation over 10 mm) and extremely wet (daily precipitation over 20 mm) days is projected to increase. Moreover, the study illustrates that only about half of the changes in total annual precipitation are projected to come from changes in the wettest 10% of wet days. In contrast, a majority of changes in variance of the annual precipitation comes from changes in variance of the wettest 10% of the wet days. This suggests that fluctuations in large storms are projected to dictate the variability of precipitation in the Delta. Additionally, a general upward trend in dry conditions measured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index is expected during the projection period. The trending signal is stronger at multi-year temporal scales (one to four years) and under the higher emission scenario. These change patterns are generally similar across three sub-regions of the Delta (i.e., North, South, and West), even though some changes in the South Delta are the most pronounced.

The latest operative projections from four representative climate models under two greenhouse-gas emission scenarios are employed for this purpose. The study shows that the temporal distribution of annual runoff is expected to change in terms of shifting more volume to the wet season (October–March) from the snowmelt season (April–July). Increases in wet season runoff volume are more noticeable under the higher (versus lower) emission scenario, while decreases in snowmelt season runoff are generally more significant under the lower (versus higher) emission scenario. In comparison, changes in the water year types are more influenced by climate models rather than emission scenarios. When comparing two regions in the Central Valley, the rain-dominated Sacramento River region is projected to experience more wet years and less critical years than the snow-dominated San Joaquin River region due to their hydroclimatic and geographic differences. Hydrological droughts in the snowmelt season and wet season mostly exhibit upward and downward trends, respectively. However, the uncertainty in the direction of the trend on annual and multi-year scales tends to be climate-model dependent.

T. Lowe, 1838) are key intermediate-level components of the marine food web of the southwestern African coast. Their biomass off Angola has shown significant interannual variability, and information about their reproduction is insufficient in the region for adequate stock management. Thus, we aimed to unveil the reproduction period and reproductive traits of these two Sardinella species and establish a link with the prevailing ocean temperature conditions. Adult fish samples were obtained monthly from artisanal and semi-industrial fleets, and the ichthyoplankton samples were collected with a Hydro-Bios Multinet off southwest Angola by Instituto Nacional de Investigação Pesqueira (Angola). The macroscopic inspection of gonads showed that females of both species were more abundant than males. The gonadosomatic index and maturity stages indicate that S. aurita spawns during the Austral summer (December through March), while S. maderensis has a longer spawning period, from October to April. The spawning peak occurs in February for S. aurita and S. maderensis. The mean monthly condition factor of both species was high before and after spawning seasons. The females of S. aurita reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than males, and 50% of the population reaches sexual maturity at a total length of 31.3 cm. The males of S. maderensis reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than females, and 50% of the population reaches sexual maturity at a total length of 28.4 cm. We also found that both species use the southern coast of Angola as a spawning area during the Austral summer and avoid the area during periods of intense upwelling. Currently, these species are managed as a single unit, and the minimum capture size is set at 22 cm, well below the size at sexual maturity registered in the study area.

The Delta’s complex nature and low-lying topography make it a unique hydrological area pertinent to climate change studies.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the effective rooting depth (the depth of soil and bedrock storage required to support AET) for 35 native vegetation types in California in order to quantify soil and bedrock water use, which ranged from 0 to 3.1 m for most vegetation types, exceeding mapped soil depths. This resulted in the quantification of bedrock water use, increasing available water 67% over that calculated by mapped soils alone.

This study addresses this challenge by developing a novel monthly data adjustment approach, the Runoff Curve Year–Type–Monthly (RC-YTM) method. The application of this method is exemplified at five key California watersheds.

This approach, demonstrably effective in capturing the observed climate change impacts on streamflow at monthly timesteps, enhances the reliability of model simulations representing contemporary conditions, which can lead to better-informed decision-making in water management, infrastructure investment, drought and flood risk assessment, and adaptation strategies.

Across California’s mountains, substantial declines (30–100% loss) in median peak annual snow water equivalent accompany changes in snow seasonality throughout the region compared to the historic period. We find that 80% of historic seasonal snowpacks transition to ephemeral conditions. Subsetting empirical-statistical wildfire projections for California by snow seasonality transition regions indicates a two-to-four-fold increase in the area burned, consistent with recent observations of high elevation wildfires following extended drought conditions. By analyzing six of the major California snow-fed river systems, we demonstrate snowpack reductions and seasonality transitions result in concomitant declines in annual runoff (47–58% of historical values). The negative impacts to statewide water supply reliability by the projected dry spell will likely be magnified by changes in snowpack seasonality and increased wildfire activity.","Analyzes the decline in seasonal snow, its dynamics, and impacts on hydrology and wildfire activity due to projected dry spells.",Hydrology,2022,9,9,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology9090155,https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/9/9/155/pdf?version=1662543641,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

We surveyed households to evaluate the effectiveness of education and outreach campaigns on self-reported use of water and chemicals and evaluated whether self-reported behaviors were reflected in the quality and quantity of water draining from the study areas before and after outreach efforts. Our research was conducted in California, which has a Mediterranean climate with distinct wet and dry periods. Runoff from residential landscapes during the dry season enters waterways undiluted by rainwater, making this runoff particularly detrimental to receiving waters. No significant differences in behavior and BMP adoption from before and after the education and outreach campaign was found.

One of the main challenges for coastal flood forecasting systems is a lack of reliable forecast data of large-scale oceanic and watershed processes and the combined effects of multiple hazards, such as compound flooding at river mouths. Offshore water level anomalies, known as remote Non-Tidal Residuals (NTRs), are caused by processes such as downwelling, offshore wind setup, and also driven by ocean-basin salinity and temperature changes, common along the west coast during El Niño events. Similarly, fluvial discharges can contribute to extreme water levels in the coastal area, while they are dominated by large-scale watershed hydraulics. However, with the recent emergence of reliable large-scale forecast systems, coastal models now import the essential input data to forecast extreme water levels in the nearshore. Accordingly, we have developed Hydro-CoSMoS, a new coastal forecast model based on the USGS Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) powered by the Delft3D San Francisco Bay and Delta community model. In this work, we studied the role of fluvial discharges and remote NTRs on extreme water levels during a February 2019 storm by using Hydro-CoSMoS in hindcast mode. We simulated the storm with and without real-time fluvial discharge data to study their effect on coastal water levels and flooding extent, and highlight the importance of watershed forecast systems such as NOAA’s National Water Model (NWM). We also studied the effect of remote NTRs on coastal water levels in San Francisco Bay during the 2019 February storm by utilizing the data from a global ocean model (HYCOM). Our results showed that accurate forecasts of remote NTRs and fluvial discharges can play a significant role in predicting extreme water levels in San Francisco Bay.

Water quality forecasting in arid river basins is especially challenging given the importance of protecting beneficial uses in these environments and the livelihood of agricultural communities. In the agriculture-dominated San Joaquin River Basin of California, real-time salinity management (RTSM) is a state-sanctioned program that helps to maximize allowable salt export while protecting existing basin beneficial uses of water supply. The RTSM strategy supplants the federal total maximum daily load (TMDL) approach that could impose fines associated with exceedances of monthly and annual salt load allocations of up to $1 million per year based on average year hydrology and salt load export limits. The essential components of the current program include the establishment of telemetered sensor networks, a web-based information system for sharing data, a basin-scale salt load assimilative capacity forecasting model and institutional entities tasked with performing weekly forecasts of river salt assimilative capacity and scheduling west-side drainage export of salt loads. Web-based information portals have been developed to share model input data and salt assimilative capacity forecasts together with increasing stakeholder awareness and involvement in water quality resource management activities in the river basin. Two modeling approaches have been developed simultaneously. The first relies on a statistical analysis of the relationship between flow and salt concentration at three compliance monitoring sites and the use of these regression relationships for forecasting. The second salt load forecasting approach is a customized application of the Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF), a watershed water quality simulation model that has been configured to estimate daily river salt assimilative capacity and to provide decision support for real-time salinity management at the watershed level. Analysis of the results from both model-based forecasting approaches over a period of five years shows that the regression-based forecasting model, run daily Monday to Friday each week, provided marginally better performance. However, the regression-based forecasting model assumes the same general relationship between flow and salinity which breaks down during extreme weather events such as droughts when water allocation cutbacks among stakeholders are not evenly distributed across the basin. A recent test case shows the utility of both models in dealing with an exceedance event at one compliance monitoring site recently introduced in 2020.",Focuses on forecasting and managing salinity to ensure water quality compliance in a river basin.,Water,2021,13,19,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/w13192661,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/19/2661/pdf?version=1632908991,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,7,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This study explores machine learning, particularly deep-learning techniques in developing computer emulators for a commonly used process model, the Delta Simulation Model II (DSM2), used for salinity estimation in California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). We apply historical daily input data to DSM2 and corresponding salinity simulations at 28 study locations from 1990 to 2019 to train two machine-learning models: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in a multi-task learning framework. We assess sensitivity of both networks to the amount of antecedent input information (memory) and training data to determine appropriate memory size and training data length. We evaluate network performance according to several statistical metrics as well as visual inspection. The study further investigates two additional networks, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Residual Network (ResNet) in salinity modeling, and compares their efficacy against MLP and LSTM. Our results demonstrate strong performance of the four neural network models over the study period, achieving absolute bias below 4%, plus near-perfect correlation coefficients and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients. The high complexity LSTM shows slight performance edge. We further show that deeper and wider versions of MLP and LSTM yield only marginal benefit over their baseline counterparts. We also examined issues related to potential overfitting by the proposed models, training data selection strategies, and analytical and practical implications.

More recently, data-driven models including artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been developed for simulating salinity. Compared to process-based models, ANNs yield faster salinity simulations with comparable accuracy. However, ANNs are often purely data-driven and not constrained by physical laws, making it difficult to interpret the causality between input and output data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are emerging machine-learning models to integrate the benefits of both process-based models and data-driven ANNs. PINNs can embed the knowledge of physical laws in terms of the partial differential equations (PDE) that govern the dynamics of salinity transport into the training of the neural networks. This study explores the application of PINNs in salinity modeling by incorporating the one-dimensional advection–dispersion salinity transport equation into the neural networks. Two PINN models are explored in this study, namely PINNs and FoNets. PINNs are multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that incorporate the advection–dispersion equation, while FoNets are an extension of PINNs with an additional encoding layer. The exploration is exemplified at four study locations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta of California: Pittsburg, Chipps Island, Port Chicago, and Martinez. Both PINN models and benchmark ANNs are trained and tested using simulated daily salinity from 1991 to 2015 at study locations. Results indicate that PINNs and FoNets outperform the benchmark ANNs in simulating salinity at the study locations. Specifically, PINNs and FoNets have lower absolute biases and higher correlation coefficients and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values than ANNs. In addition, PINN models overcome some limitations of purely data-driven ANNs (e.g., neuron saturation) and generate more realistic salinity simulations.

Understanding the temporal and spatial variations of salinity is a keystone of salinity-management practices. Process-based numerical models have been traditionally used to estimate the variations in salinity in estuarine environments. Advances in data-driven models (e.g., deep learning models) make them effective and efficient alternatives to process-based models. However, a discernible research gap exists in applying these advanced techniques to salinity modeling. The current study seeks to address this gap by exploring the innovative use of deep learning with data augmentation and transfer learning in salinity modeling, exemplified at 23 key salinity locations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta which is the hub of the water-supply system of California. Historical, simulated (via a hydrodynamics and water quality model), and perturbed (to create a range of hydroclimatic and operational scenarios for data-augmentation purposes) flow, and salinity data are used to train a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a deep learning Residual Long-Short-Term Memory (Res-LSTM) network. Four other deep learning models including LSTM, Residual Network (ResNet), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Residual GRU (Res-GRU) are also examined. Results indicate that models pre-trained using augmented data demonstrate improved performance over models trained from scratch using only historical data (e.g., median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency increased from around 0.5 to above 0.9). Moreover, the five deep learning models further boost the salinity estimation performance in comparison with the baseline MLP model, though the performance of the latter is acceptable. The models trained using augmented data are then (a) used to develop a web-based Salinity Dashboard (Dashboard) tool that allows the users (including those with no machine learning background) to quickly screen multiple management scenarios by altering inputs and visualizing the resulting salinity simulations interactively, and (b) transferred and adapted to estimate observed salinity. The study shows that transfer learning results more accurately replicate the observations compared to their counterparts from models trained from scratch without knowledge learned and transferred from augmented data (e.g., median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency increased from around 0.4 to above 0.9). Overall, the study illustrates that deep learning models, particularly when pre-trained using augmented data, are promising supplements to existing process-based models in estuarine salinity modeling, while the Dashboard enables user engagement with those pre-trained models to inform decision-making efficiently and effectively.","Applies deep learning, data augmentation, and transfer learning for estuarine salinity modeling.",Water,2023,15,13,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/w15132482,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/13/2482/pdf?version=1688639031,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,14,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Minxue He,2,BDO

Agriculture is reliant on the conjunctive use of surface-water and groundwater. The lack of available surface-water and land-use changes have led to pumping-induced groundwater-level and storage declines, land subsidence, changes to streamflow and the environment, and the degradation of water quality. As a result, in part, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) was developed. An examination of the components of SGMA and contextualizing regional model applications within the SGMA framework was undertaken to better understand and quantify many of the components of SGMA. Specifically, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) updated the Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) to assess hydrologic system responses to climatic variation, surface-water availability, land-use changes, and groundwater pumping. MODFLOW-OWHM has been enhanced to simulate the timing of land subsidence and attribute its inelastic and elastic portions. In addition to extending CVHM through 2019, the new version, CVHM2, includes several enhancements as follows: managed aquifer recharge (MAR), pumping with multi-aquifer wells, inflows from ungauged watersheds, and more detailed water-balance subregions, streamflow network, diversions, tile drains, land use, aquifer properties, and groundwater level and land subsidence observations. Combined with historical approximations, CVHM2 estimates approximately 158 km3 of storage loss in the Central Valley from pre-development to 2019. About 15% of the total storage loss is permanent loss of storage from subsidence that has caused damage to infrastructure. Climate extremes will likely complicate the efforts of water managers to store more water in the ground. CVHM2 can provide data in the form of aggregated input datasets, simulate climatic variations and changes, land-use changes or water management scenarios, and resulting changes in groundwater levels, storage, and land subsidence to assist decision-makers in the conjunctive management of water supplies.",Examines human impacts on groundwater systems and their management under climate change.,Water,2024,16,8,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/w16081189,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/8/1189/pdf?version=1713791061,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,18,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Although diversity has been identified as a goal for effective resource management and genetic and demographic tools have been developed, life history remains challenging to quantify. In this study, we demonstrate a novel metric of life history diversity using telemetry data from migratory fish. Here, we examined diversity in the outmigration behavior of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) released in the Sacramento River, California, between 2007 and 2017. In this synthesis, we examined a wide variety of landscape and demographic drivers at high resolution by incorporating many individual telemetry studies, with variability in release location by year, environmental conditions, and all runs of salmon that are present in the watershed. When years were grouped by shared hydrologic conditions, variation in travel time was significantly higher in wet years. Further, our model showed a negative effect of warm temperatures at low flows on the variation in migration movements. This suggests that enhanced hydrologic connectivity increases the variation in migration time, a representation of habitat complexity and biocomplexity, despite the degraded state of this watershed and the weakened state of these populations. Variation in migration behavior could buffer species from current and future environmental changes, such as climate effects on precipitation and temperature.

Membrane performance characterization showed that, for the above ranges of pH and salinity, the SNS-PAA-PSf UF membrane can overcome the typical membrane perm-selectivity tradeoff. The above performance is attributed to the swelling of the tethered PAA chains, upon ionic strength decrease or pH increase, which provides a less hindered transmembrane solute transport path, but increased hydraulic resistance. Conversely, at high ionic stress or low pH tethered chain collapse leads to lower molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) but with hydraulic resistance below that of the swollen state.

This is of even greater concern if the native species is of conservation concern. The giant gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, an endemic predator of the Central Valley of California and a species of conservation concern at the state and federal levels, has declined as a result of conversion of its once vast wetland habitat to agriculture. Another anthropogenic factor contributing to this snake's changing ecology is the introduction of nonnative prey into the species' habitats. These introductions have resulted in a prey community that is almost completely composed of exotic species and have potential for considerable effects. In order to assess prey preference and selection we performed three sets of behavioral trials on naïve neonates. We examined 1) neonate prey preference in response to olfactory cues of prepared prey extracts, 2) neonate consumption of different live prey items presented simultaneously; and 3) terrestrial feeding behavior and/or latency to successful attack. Results from the olfactory study suggest that native Sierran treefrogs, Pseudacris sierra, are preferred by neonates. Results from consumption trials suggest that neonates are more likely to select frog species than fish species. This is the first study that we are aware of that examines prey selection of this threatened species and serves to inform its conservation and management.",Examines impact of nonnative prey on a threatened native predator.,Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management,2020,11,1,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,https://doi.org/10.3996/062019-jfwm-051,https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfwm/article-pdf/11/1/164/2511420/i1944-687x-11-1-164.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,4,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20∘ S to 20∘ N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database.

Mechanisms causing these shifts remain largely unknown and are not well represented in hydrologic models. Focusing on measurements from the headwaters of California's Feather River, we found that also in these mixed rain–snow Mediterranean basins a lower fraction of precipitation was partitioned to runoff during multi-year droughts compared to non-drought years. This shift in the precipitation–runoff relationship was larger in the surface-runoff-dominated than subsurface-flow-dominated headwaters (−39 % vs. −18 % decline of runoff, respectively, for a representative precipitation amount). The predictive skill of the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) hydrologic model in these basins decreased during droughts, with evapotranspiration (ET) being the only water-balance component besides runoff for which the drop in predictive skill during drought vs. non-drought years was statistically significant. In particular, the model underestimated the response time required by ET to adjust to interannual climate variability, which we define as climate elasticity of ET. Differences between simulated and data-driven estimates of ET were well correlated with accompanying data-driven estimates of changes in sub-surface storage (ΔS, r=0.78). This correlation points to shifts in precipitation–runoff relationships being evidence of a hysteretic response of the water budget to climate elasticity of ET during and after multi-year droughts. This hysteresis is caused by carryover storage offsetting precipitation deficit during the initial drought period, followed by vegetation mortality when storage is depleted and subsequent post-drought vegetation expansion. Our results point to a general improvement in hydrologic predictions across drought and recovery cycles by including the climate elasticity of ET and better accounting for actual subsurface water storage in not only soil, but also deeper regolith that stores water accessible to roots. This can be done by explicitly parametrizing carryover storage and feedback mechanisms capturing vegetation response to atmospheric demand for moisture.","Examines shifts in water balance, evapotranspiration, and runoff during multi-year droughts using hydrologic models.",Hydrology and earth system sciences,2020,24,9,Copernicus GmbH,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4317-2020,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/4317/2020/hess-24-4317-2020.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,86,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Recent studies indicate a shift toward increased precipitation falling as rain, which is consistent with a warming climate. An approach is presented to estimate precipitation-phase partitioning across landscapes from 1948 to the present by combining fine-scale gridded precipitation data with coarse-scale freezing level and precipitation data from an atmospheric reanalysis. A marriage of these data sets allows for a new approach to estimate spatial patterns and trends in precipitation partitioning over elevational and latitudinal gradients in major water supply basins. This product is used in California as a diagnostic indicator of changing precipitation phase across mountain watersheds. Results show the largest increases in precipitation falling as rain during the past 70 years in lower elevation watersheds located within the climatological rain–snow transition regions of northern California during spring.

Land surface models (LSMs), such as the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model and the Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP), play an essential role in providing comprehensive runoff predictions across the region. Virtually all LSMs require parameter estimation (calibration) to optimize their predictive capabilities. Here, we focus on the calibration of VIC and Noah-MP models at a 1/16° latitude–longitude resolution across the Western United States. We first performed global optimal calibration of parameters for both models for 263 river basins in the region. We find that the calibration significantly improves the models' performance, with the median daily streamflow Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) increasing from 0.37 to 0.70 for VIC, and from 0.22 to 0.54 for Noah-MP. In general, post-calibration model performance is higher for watersheds with relatively high precipitation and runoff ratios, and at lower elevations. At a second stage, we regionalize the river basin calibrations using the donor-basin method, which establishes transfer relationships for hydrologically similar basins, via which we extend our calibration parameters to 4816 hydrologic unit code (HUC)-10 basins across the region. Using the regionalized parameters, we show that the models' capabilities to simulate high and low flow conditions are substantially improved following calibration and regionalization.

Rapid postfire hazard assessments have traditionally focused on quantifying spatial variations in debris-flow likelihood and volume in response to design rainstorms. However, a methodology that provides estimates of debris-flow inundation downstream of burned areas based on forecast rainfall would provide decision-makers with information that directly addresses the potential for downstream impacts. We introduce a framework that integrates a 24 h lead-time ensemble precipitation forecast with debris-flow likelihood, volume, and runout models to produce probabilistic maps of debris-flow inundation. We applied this framework to simulate debris-flow inundation associated with the 9 January 2018 debris-flow event in Montecito, California, USA. When the observed debris-flow volumes were used to drive the probabilistic forecast model, analysis of the simulated inundation probabilities demonstrates that the model is both reliable and sharp. In the fully predictive model, however, in which debris-flow likelihood and volume were computed from the atmospheric model ensemble's predictions of peak 15 min rainfall intensity, I15, the model generally under-forecasted the inundation area. The observed peak I15 lies in the upper tail of the atmospheric model ensemble spread; thus a large fraction of ensemble members forecast lower I15 than observed. Using these I15 values as input to the inundation model resulted in lower-than-observed flow volumes which translated into under-forecasting of the inundation area. Even so, approximately 94 % of the observed inundated area was forecast to have an inundation probability greater than 1 %, demonstrating that the observed extent of inundation was generally captured within the range of outcomes predicted by the model. Sensitivity analyses indicate that debris-flow volume and two parameters associated with debris-flow mobility exert significant influence on inundation predictions, but reducing uncertainty in postfire debris-flow volume predictions will have the largest impact on reducing inundation outcome uncertainty. This study represents a first step toward a near-real-time hazard assessment product that includes probabilistic estimates of debris-flow inundation and provides guidance for future improvements to this and similar model frameworks by identifying key sources of uncertainty.",Models postfire debris-flow inundation from forecast rainfall for hazard assessment and informing decision-makers.,Natural hazards and earth system sciences,2024,24,7,Copernicus GmbH,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2359-2024,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/24/2359/2024/nhess-24-2359-2024.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Complete water retention and conductivity curves for the top (0–5 cm) and subsurface (20–25 cm) soils were characterized and contrasted. Dynamic water storage and retention were evaluated using numerical simulations in HYDRUS-2D software. Compared with standard-till (ST) and no-cover-crop (NO) systems, soils under no-till (NT) and cover cropping (CC) systems showed improved soil structure in terms of pore size distribution (PSD). Changes in hydraulic conductivity (K) under these systems led to an increased infiltration rate and water retention. However, NT and CC plots had lower water content at field capacity (33 kPa suction) and lower plant-available water (PAW) compared with ST and NO plots. Numerical simulations, however, showed that NT and CC plots have higher water storage (albeit marginal in magnitude) and water availability following irrigation. Because the numerical simulations considered retention and conductivity functions simultaneously and dynamically through time, they allow the capture of hydraulic states that are arguably more relevant to crops. The study concludes that the long-term practices of NT and CC systems were beneficial in terms of changes to the PSD.

With the rapidly growing interest in polar ARs during the past decade, it is imperative to establish an objective framework quantifying the strength and impact of these ARs for both scientific research and practical applications. The AR scale introduced by Ralph et al. (2019) ranks ARs based on the duration of AR conditions and the intensity of integrated water vapor transport (IVT). However, the thresholds of IVT used to rank ARs are selected based on the IVT climatology at middle latitudes. These thresholds are insufficient for polar regions due to the substantially lower temperature and moisture content. In this study, we analyze the IVT climatology in polar regions, focusing on the coasts of Antarctica and Greenland. Then we introduce an extended version of the AR scale tuned to polar regions by adding lower IVT thresholds of 100, 150, and 200 kg m−1 s−1 to the standard AR scale, which starts at 250 kg m−1 s−1. The polar AR scale is utilized to examine AR frequency, seasonality, trends, and associated precipitation and surface melt over Antarctica and Greenland. Our results show that the polar AR scale better characterizes the strength and impacts of ARs in the Antarctic and Arctic regions than the original AR scale and has the potential to enhance communication across observational, research, and forecasting communities in polar regions.",Characterizes atmospheric rivers and their impact on polar weather and climate dynamics.,The cryosphere,2024,18,11,Copernicus GmbH,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-5239-2024,https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/18/5239/2024/tc-18-5239-2024.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,5,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

In this study, eDNA detection targeted delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ), a critically endangered estuarine fish associated with turbid water. eDNA sampling in the field was first paired with a trawl survey. Species-specific detection using a Taqman qPCR assay showed concordance between the methods, but a weak eDNA signal. Informed by the results of field sampling, an experiment was designed to assess how turbidity and filtration methods influence detection of a rare target. Water from non-turbid (5 NTU) and turbid (50 NTU) estuarine sites was spiked with small volumes (0.5 and 1 mL) of water from a delta smelt tank to generate low eDNA concentrations. Samples were filtered using four filter types: cartridge filters (pore size 0.45 μm) and 47 mm filters (glass fiber, pore size 1.6 μm and polycarbonate, pore sizes 5 and 10 μm). Prefiltration was also tested as an addition to the filtration protocol for turbid water samples. eDNA copy numbers were analyzed using a censored data method for qPCR data. The assay limits and lack of PCR inhibition indicated an optimized assay. Glass fiber filters yielded the highest detection rates and eDNA copies in non-turbid and turbid water. Prefiltration improved detection in turbid water only when used with cartridge and polycarbonate filters. Statistical analysis identified turbidity as a significant effect on detection probability and eDNA copies detected; filter type and an interaction between filter type and prefilter were significant effects on eDNA copies detected, suggesting that particulate-filter interactions can affect detection sensitivity. Pilot experiments and transparent criteria for positive detection could improve eDNA surveys of rare species in turbid environments.",The article focuses on evaluating methods for detecting a rare fish species using environmental DNA in turbid water.,PeerJ,2024,11,,PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.16453,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,15,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Melinda R.

We characterized the frequency and timing (start time, end time, and duration) of incubation recesses for mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and gadwall (Mareca strepera) hens breeding in Suisun Marsh, California, USA, and examined the influences of day of year, ambient temperature at the nest, incubation day, and clutch size on recess frequency and timing using linear mixed models. Mallard, on average, took more recesses per day (1.69 ± 0.80, mean ± standard deviation) than did gadwall (1.39 ± 0.69), and 45% of mallard nest-days were characterized by two recesses, while only 27% of gadwall nest-days were characterized by two recesses. Mallard morning recesses started at 06:14 ± 02:46 and lasted 106.11 ± 2.01 min, whereas mallard afternoon recesses started at 16:39 ± 02:11 and lasted 155.39 ± 1.99 min. Gadwall morning recesses started at 06:30 ± 02:46 and lasted 91.28 ± 2.32 min, and gadwall afternoon recesses started at 16:31 ± 01:57 and lasted 192.69 ± 1.89 min. Mallard and gadwall started recesses earlier in the day with increasing ambient temperature, but later in the day as the season progressed. Recess duration decreased as the season progressed and as clutch size increased, and increased with ambient temperature at the nest. The impending darkness of sunset appeared to be a strong cue for ending a recess and returning to the nest, because hens returned to their nests earlier than expected when recesses were expected to end after sunset. Within hens, the timing of incubation recesses was repeatable across incubation days and was most repeatable for mallard afternoon recesses and on days in which hens took only one recess. Hens were most likely to be away from nests between 04:00 and 07:00 and between 16:00 and 19:00; therefore, investigators should search for nests between 07:00 and 16:00.

Over a recent three-year period, the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada fluctuated from the lightest in recorded history (2015) to historically heaviest (2017), with a relatively average year in between (2016). This large dynamic range in climatic conditions presents a unique opportunity to investigate correlations between annual water availability and runoff in a snow-dominated catchment. Here, we estimate ET using a water balance approach where the water inputs to the system are spatially constrained using a combination of remote sensing, physically based modelling, and in-situ observations. For all 3 years of this study, the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) combined periodic high-resolution snow depths from airborne Lidar with snow density estimates from an energy and mass balance model to produce spatial estimates of snow water equivalent over the Tuolumne headwater catchment at 50-m resolution. Using observed reservoir inflow at the basin outlet and the well-quantified snowmelt model results that benefit from periodic ASO snow depth updates, we estimate annual ET, runoff efficiency (RE), and the associated uncertainty across these three dissimilar water years. Throughout the study period, estimated annual ET magnitudes remained steady (222 mm in 2015, 151 mm in 2016, and 299 mm in 2017) relative to the large differences in basin input precipitation (547 mm in 2015, 1,060 mm in 2016, and 2,211 mm in 2017). These values compare well with independent satellite-derived ET estimates and previously published studies in this basin. Results reveal that ET in the Tuolumne does not scale linearly with the amount of available water to the basin, and that RE primarily depends on total annual snowfall proportion of precipitation.","Analyzes water balance, snowpack, precipitation, and runoff in a river basin.",Hydrological Processes,2020,,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13749,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hyp.13749,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,other-oa,37,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Prospecting for nesting locations and migratory stopover sites are well-established behaviours among bird species. We assessed whether three species of California dabbling ducks – mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, gadwall, Mareca strepera, and cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera – in Suisun Marsh, California, U.S.A., a brackish marsh, prospect for suitable wetlands in the week prior to brooding. K-means cluster analyses grouped 29 mallard and gadwall hens into three groups. One group (N = 13) demonstrated evidence of brood site prospecting, with the fewest and latest prebrooding wetland visits. Of these hens, seven visited their future brood pond an average of 1.14 times and only shortly before brooding (1.29 days), obtaining current information on habitat suitability. For the remaining six hens, we did not detect a brooding wetland visit, possibly due to data limitations or because these hens acquired sufficient familiarity with the wetland habitat during nest breaks in adjacent wetlands, obviating the need to prospect the specific brood pond. The second identified group of hens (N = 11) visited the brooding wetland most frequently (on 4.55 days), further in advance (5.27 days), with the fewest unique wetland visits and the earliest brooding date (26 May). The final group of hens (N = 5) were the latest to brood (21 June) and visited the most wetlands, possibly due to less water or more broods present across the landscape. Brood ponds were always farther from the nest than the nearest ponds, indicating that habitat suitability or presence of conspecifics is more important to brood site selection. Prospecting provides hens with knowledge about current habitat conditions and allows them to 'crowdsource' public information regarding use of that habitat by other brooding hens. Prospecting may, therefore, benefit ducks inhabiting ephemeral habitats like those within Suisun Marsh, where brood habitat is limited and water cover changes rapidly during the breeding season.",The article focuses on waterfowl brood site selection behavior and ecology in a marsh environment.,Animal Behaviour,2020,164,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.04.013,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,25,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Cliff L.

The Tss data for snow-free and annual mean periods exhibit wider inter-site ranges than published observations for other regions, attributable to the great diversity of ground surface environments sampled. Two energy balance based models of ground surface temperature are introduced, each applicable to a wide variety of surface environments and formulated with regional calibration coefficients that can incorporate effects of seasonal snow-cover on annual mean Tss. The models closely fit summer monthly and annual mean Tss data from most sites, and confirm that the large inter-site range of shading (by vegetation and terrain) is responsible for most of the large inter-site range of observed Tss.

Lehman; Tomofumi Kurobe; Swee J. Teh,California Department of Water Resources; University of California Davis,,biological and ecological sciences,aquatic ecology,0.95,"Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs) became a concern in the upper San Francisco Estuary, California beginning in 1999, when yearly blooms of Microcystis began in the Delta region. Subsequent research identified that the increase in the magnitude, duration and toxicity of Microcystis blooms was associated with drought related conditions of elevated water temperature and low streamflow. However, the impact of extreme conditions on the resilience of the bloom was unknown. The 2014 and 2017 water years provided a unique opportunity to determine the effect of climatic ""whiplash"" produced by the occurrence of extreme wet conditions following extreme dry conditions on the Microcystis bloom. We hypothesized that the period of record wet conditions in 2017 (1906-2018) would eliminate the Microcystis bloom for that year and perhaps revert the estuary phytoplankton community back to pre-bloom conditions due to extreme flushing, despite the increase in magnitude and spatial and temporal distribution of the Microcystis bloom during the 2014 extreme dry year. Field sampling was conducted at 2-week or 4-week intervals between July and November at stations throughout the Delta for both years and included a suite of physical, chemical and biological factors. Using PRIMER-e DISTLM, we determined that retention time in the upper estuary and water temperature were key environmental correlates with the Microcystis bloom amplitude and in regression models described 58-78% of the variation of the bloom surface biovolume or subsurface abundance. The period of record high streamflow in 2017 was not enough to eliminate the Microcystis bloom. However, the bloom was small in 2017, with a low abundance, late initiation, short duration, narrow distribution and low toxin production. Warm water temperature enabled the bloom to flower in late summer despite streamflow many times those measured previously. In addition, although conditions early in the summer of 2017 favored diatoms, the summer was characterized by an abundance of other non-Microcystis cyanobacteria. We conclude that once established, Microcystis is likely to be resistant to extreme wet conditions, as long as water temperature and other key water quality conditions are favorable.",Study of Microcystis harmful algal blooms and their ecological interactions with extreme environmental conditions in an estuary.,Quaternary International,2020,621,,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.12.003,,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,51,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,Peggy W.

We also use outputs from a hydrological model to evaluate the effect of snowfall intensity on ablation in future climate scenarios.

Climate change‐induced increases to the duration and intensity of fire conditions have made smoke a common occurrence across western North America, with largely unquantified ecosystem feedbacks. Under equivalent amounts of radiation, increased atmospheric particulate matter could lead to a boost in productivity as scattering redistributes photons throughout multilayer canopies. In this work, we leverage a meso‐network of eddy covariance measurement sites across a unique array of managed and restored C 3 and C 4 canopy types to understand how recent wildfire smoke affected ecosystem productivity during the summer of 2018, an especially smoky year in the agriculturally productive Central Valley. We find that diffuse PAR diffuse increased by more than a third compared to the previous growing season, while total PAR was only slightly diminished. These conditions caused nearly a doubling of light use efficiency over the range of diffuse fraction observed, with the highest sensitivity to diffuse fraction exhibited by corn and alfalfa crops. We utilized an empirical model to assess the trade‐off between enhanced diffuse fraction and reduced total PAR. Under mean radiation conditions, daily integrated gross ecosystem productivity increased by 1.2–4.2% compared to the previous growing season. Finally, we explore the potential negative effect of heightened ozone, a copollutant often associated with wildfire.

Here we demonstrate how, on daily timescales, interactions between the NP4 modes drive coastal flow that can result in dry conditions from atmospheric ridging or wet conditions associated with enhanced onshore flow and atmospheric river (AR) landfalls. Seasonally, the prevalence of certain NP4 phase relationships can tip the scale toward wet or dry conditions.

While recent studies have shown that methane (CH 4 ) emissions can potentially offset the carbon burial rates in low‐salinity coastal wetlands, there is hitherto a paucity of direct and year‐round measurements of ecosystem‐scale CH 4 flux (F CH4 ) from mangrove ecosystems. In this study, we examined the temporal variations and biophysical drivers of ecosystem‐scale F CH4 in a subtropical estuarine mangrove wetland based on 3 years of eddy covariance measurements. Our results showed that daily mangrove F CH4 reached a peak of over 0.1 g CH 4 ‐C m −2 day −1 during the summertime owing to a combination of high temperature and low salinity, while the wintertime F CH4 was negligible. In this mangrove, the mean annual CH 4 emission was 11.7 ± 0.4 g CH 4 ‐C m –2 year −1 while the annual net ecosystem CO 2 exchange ranged between −891 and −690 g CO 2 ‐C m −2 year −1 , indicating a net cooling effect on climate over decadal to centurial timescales. Meanwhile, we showed that mangrove F CH4 could offset the negative radiative forcing caused by CO 2 uptake by 52% and 24% over a time horizon of 20 and 100 years, respectively, based on the corresponding sustained‐flux global warming potentials. Moreover, we found that 87% and 69% of the total variance of daily F CH4 could be explained by the random forest machine learning algorithm and traditional linear regression model, respectively, with soil temperature and salinity being the most dominant controls. This study was the first of its kind to characterize ecosystem‐scale F CH4 in a mangrove wetland with long‐term eddy covariance measurements. Our findings implied that future environmental changes such as climate warming and increasing river discharge might increase CH 4 emissions and hence reduce the net radiative cooling effect of estuarine mangrove forests.",Studies methane emissions from mangroves and their impact on the radiative cooling effect and global warming potential.,Global Change Biology,2020,26,9,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15247,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,71,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Forecasts of atmospheric rain–snow levels from December 2016 to March 2017, a period of active AR landfalls, are evaluated using 19 profiling radars in California. Three forecast model products are assessed: a global forecast model downscaled to 3-km grid spacing, 4-km river forecast center operational forecasts, and 50-km global ensemble reforecasts. Model forecasts of the rain–snow level are compared with observations of rain–snow melting-level brightband heights. Models produce mean bias magnitudes of less than 200 m across a range of forecast lead times. Error magnitudes increase with lead time and are similar between models, averaging 342 m for lead times of 24 h or less and growing to 700–800 m for lead times of greater than 144 h. Observed extremes in the rain–snow level are underestimated, particularly for warmer events, and the magnitude of errors increases with rain–snow level. Storms with high rain–snow levels are correlated with larger observed precipitation rates in Sierra Nevada watersheds. Flood risk increases with rain–snow levels, not only because a greater fraction of the watershed receives rain, but also because warmer storms carry greater water vapor and thus can produce heavier precipitation. The uncertainty of flood forecasts grows nonlinearly with the rain–snow level for these reasons as well.

To improve monitoring and prediction of these events at spatial and temporal resolutions of interest to area water managers, the Bay Area Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information project was developed. To quantify improvements in forecast precipitation, model validation studies require a reference dataset to compare against. In this paper we examine 10 gridded, high-resolution (≤10 km, hourly) precipitation estimates to assess the uncertainty of high-resolution quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) in areas of complex terrain. The products were linearly interpolated to 3-km grid spacing, which is the resolution of the operational forecast model to be validated. Substantial differences exist between the various products at accumulation periods ranging from hourly to annual, with standard deviations among the products exceeding 100% of the mean. While the products seem to agree fairly well on the timing of precipitation, intensity estimates differ, sometimes by an order of magnitude. The results highlight both the need for additional observations and the need to account for uncertainty in the reference dataset when validating forecasts in this area.","Focuses on high-resolution precipitation estimates, forecasting, and atmospheric events for water management.",Journal of Hydrometeorology,2020,21,5,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-19-0160.1,https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/hydr/21/5/jhm-d-19-0160.1.pdf,TRUE,TRUE,bronze,,25,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

This study uses the dropsonde observations collected during the AR Recon campaign and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to evaluate forecasts of ARs. Results show that ECMWF IFS forecasts 1) were colder than observations by up to 0.6 K throughout the troposphere; 2) have a dry bias in the lower troposphere, which along with weaker winds below 950 hPa, resulted in weaker horizontal water vapor fluxes in the 950–1000-hPa layer; and 3) exhibit an underdispersiveness in the water vapor flux that largely arises from model representativeness errors associated with dropsondes.

Unbiased genetic approaches could provide a much-needed complementary approach that has more precision than relying on visual inspection of exit holes. In this study we developed a DNA sequencing-based method for indirect detection of VELB/CELB from frass (insect fecal matter), which can be easily and non-invasively collected from exit holes. Frass samples were collected from 37 locations and the 12S and 16S mitochondrial genes were partially sequenced using nested PCR amplification. Three frass-derived sequences showed 100% sequence identity to VELB/CELB barcode references from museum specimens sequenced for this study. Database queries of frass-derived sequences also revealed high similarity to common occupants of old VELB feeding galleries, including earwigs, flies, and other beetles. Overall, this non-invasive approach is a first step towards a genetic assay that could augment existing VELB monitoring and accurately discriminate between VELB, CELB, and other insects.

The subsequent closures were unprecedented in length and geographic extent, generating an economic shock for fishing communities. We sought to identify effective adaptive actions used in fishery-dependent communities in response to this event. Using survey data collected across 16 fishing communities following the 2015 HAB event, we empirically identified factors affecting an individual's: 1) absolute magnitude of income loss, 2) likelihood of income loss recovery, and 3) severity of emotional stress. Our findings indicate that individuals who suffered greater absolute income losses were exposed to longer fisheries closures, more dependent on shellfish as a source of income, and employed in the fishing industry. Income diversification was an effective strategy for reducing and/or recovering HAB related income losses. Advertising was also found to be an effective income recovery strategy, but for fishers it was associated with increased emotional stress. If increasing the adaptive capacity of fishery-dependent coastal communities to HAB events is a policy goal, then costs to adaptive action such as emotional stress, limited access to alternate fisheries, new fishing gear, a lack of alternate job skills or access to job networks, and a lack of advertising know-how will need to be addressed.","Examines how fishing communities adapt to harmful algal blooms, integrating social and economic factors with water systems impacts.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2020,6,,Frontiers Media SA,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00803,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00803/pdf,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,25,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Julia A.

Species with uniparental incubation must balance time spent incubating eggs with time spent away from the nest to satisfy self-maintenance needs. Patterns of nest attendance, therefore, influence embryonic development and the time it takes for eggs to hatch. We studied nest attendance (time on the nest), incubation constancy (time nests were at incubation temperatures), and variation in nest temperature of 1,414 dabbling duck nests of three species in northern California. Daily nest attendance increased from only 1–3% on the day the first egg was laid to 51–57% on the day of clutch completion, and 80–83% after clutch completion through hatch. Variation in nest temperature also decreased gradually during egg-laying, and then dropped sharply (33–38%) between the day of and the day after clutch completion because increased nest attendance, particularly at night, resulted in more consistent nest temperatures. During the egg-laying stage, nocturnal nest attendance was low (13–25%), whereas after clutch completion, nest attendance was greater at night (≥87%) than during the day (70–77%) because most incubation recesses occurred during the day. Moreover, during egg-laying, nest attendance and incubation constancy increased more slowly among nests with larger final clutch sizes, suggesting that the number of eggs remaining to be laid is a major driver of incubation effort during egg-laying. Although overall nest attendance after clutch completion was similar among species, the average length of individual incubation bouts was greatest among gadwall ( Mareca strepera ; 779 minutes), followed by mallard ( Anas platyrhynchos ; 636 minutes) and then cinnamon teal ( Spatula cyanoptera ; 347 minutes). These results demonstrate that dabbling ducks moderate their incubation behavior according to nest stage, nest age, time of day, and clutch size and this moderation likely has important implications for egg development and overall nest success.",Studies incubation behavior and nest attendance patterns in dabbling ducks.,PLoS ONE,2023,18,5,Public Library of Science (PLoS),https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286151,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286151&type=printable,TRUE,TRUE,gold,public-domain,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Thermodynamic profiles obtained from the NOAA Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive, COSMIC-1 GPS radio occultations, and several reanalyses are examined alongside Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation estimates. Cyclical increases and decreases in a bulk measure of lower-tropospheric convective instability are shown to be coupled to the cyclical amplification and decay of convection. This cyclical flow emerges from conditional-mean analysis in a thermodynamic space composed of two components: a measure of “undiluted” instability, which neglects lower-free-tropospheric (LFT) entrainment, and a measure of the reduction of instability by LFT entrainment. The observational and reanalysis products examined share the following qualitatively robust characterization of these convective cycles: increases in undiluted instability tend to occur when the LFT is less saturated, are followed by increases in LFT saturation and precipitation rate, which are then followed by decreases in undiluted instability. Shallow, convective, and stratiform precipitation are coupled to these cycles in a manner consistent with meteorological expectations. In situ and satellite observations differ systematically from reanalyses in their depictions of lower-tropospheric temperature and moisture variations throughout these convective cycles. When using reanalysis thermodynamic fields, these systematic differences cause variations in lower-free-tropospheric saturation deficit to appear less influential in determining the strength of convection than is suggested by observations. Disagreements among reanalyses, as well as between reanalyses and observations, pose significant challenges to process-level assessments of thermodynamic–convection coupling.","Focuses on atmospheric processes, specifically thermodynamic-convection coupling and convective cycles.",Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences,2022,79,7,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jas-d-21-0256.1,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The WW200En precipitation forecast skill is better than GEFS at nearly all thresholds and lead times, and comparable or better than the EPS. For larger rainfall thresholds WW200En typically exhibits the best forecast skill. Additionally, WW200En has a better spread-skill relationship than the global systems, and an improved overall reliability and resolution of the probabilistic prediction.

Yet, conventional animal tracking often precludes tracking small juveniles at critical life stages where recruitment bottlenecks often manifest. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) in consecutive laminae in eye lenses, a protein‐rich depositional tissue, has emerged as a promising tool in fishes to develop long‐term interpretive records of dietary histories using a single archival tissue. Currently, studies using fish eye lenses to study SIA in diets have primarily been conducted in marine environments using δ 13 C and δ 15 N to identify resource partitioning, ontogenetic shifts and lifelong trophic histories. To date, no studies have examined freshwater taxa nor used δ 34 S isotopes. We placed juvenile (Chinook Salmon) Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in experimental enclosures in three different freshwater habitats (hatchery, river and seasonal floodplain), each with isotopically distinct and well‐characterized food webs. This experimental approach allowed us to directly measure diets and quantify tissue turnover rates in eye lenses as well as the isotopic fractionation among fish tissues (fin and muscle tissue) in distinct habitat types using stable isotopes δ 13 C, δ 15 N and δ 34 S. Bulk eye‐lens stable isotope measurements were analysed for juvenile salmon lenses and were found to be consistent with the isotopic values of rearing habitats. Slight additional isotopic fractionation was only found in δ 13 C. We then successfully applied the method to a larger, reproductively mature adult salmon captured in freshwater and inferred juvenile habitat use. SIA in eye lenses using three dietary isotopes (δ 13 C, δ 15 N and δ 34 S) has significant potential for answering critical questions about migration, diet, foraging ecology and life history of migratory aquatic animals on Earth.

The EWEs are clustered into two periods during February 2019: record cold and kona low conditions over Hawaii, lower elevation snow across Washington, and heavy AR-related rainfall in Southern California from 9 to 15 February; and heavy snow in Arizona and Oregon and heavy rainfall in Northern California from 21 to 28 February. From a weather regime perspective, the NPAC flow was dominated by a persistent ridge around 150°W, a retracted NPAC jet stream, repeated western NPAC (WPAC) cyclogenesis events, and frequent positively tilted troughs in the eastern NPAC and over western North America. Dynamically relevant features on the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) time scale include a slowly propagating MJO signal in phases 6 and 7, a rapid NPAC jet retraction around 9 February, and subsequent eastward extension toward a climatological jet position around 21 February. On synoptic time scales, Rossby wave breaking on the southern flank of the NPAC jet and within the aforementioned persistent ridge led to the kona low formation and many of the positively tilted troughs responsible for the extreme precipitation events. In addition, frequent cyclogenesis west of the date line helped to maintain the persistent ridge strength and location through favorable heat and vorticity fluxes. The chronology and complex linkages between these aforementioned features and mechanisms are explained in depth in this paper. Significance Statement This study identified several extreme cold, rain, and snow events across the western contiguous United States and Hawaii, showed how these events are all connected to a persistent weather pattern upstream over the North Pacific basin, and identified key mechanisms for why the weather pattern was so persistent. Some of the physical mechanisms for keeping the weather pattern stagnant include anomalous convection within the tropics off the east coast of Asia, breaking waves in the atmosphere like waves breaking on a beach, and repeated cyclone development off the coast of Russia and Alaska. We hope that the results of this paper encourage others to look for similar mechanisms for similar stagnant weather patterns in a more holistic manner.",Analyzes atmospheric processes and dynamic linkages governing extreme weather events and persistent flow regimes.,Monthly Weather Review,2024,152,9,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/mwr-d-24-0040.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The methodology is applied to postprocessing of 24-h accumulated PQPFs from an ensemble forecast system recently introduced by the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes (CW3E) and for lead times from 1 to 6 days. The ensemble system was designed based on a high-resolution version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, named West-WRF, to produce a 200-member ensemble in near–real time (NRT) over the western United States during the boreal cool seasons to support Forecast-Informdayed Reservoir Operations (FIRO) and studies of prediction of heavy-to-extreme events.

Applying alternating currents (AC) to such surfaces can prevent surface crystallization under certain conditions. Here, we demonstrate that ion displacement induced by periodic charging and discharging of the electrical double layer (EDL) inhibits both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation (and crystal growth) of CaCO 3 . Titanium sheets (meant to simulate metallic heat exchanger surfaces) are immersed in super-saturated CaCO 3 solutions with a saturation index &gt;11. We show that at relatively high AC frequencies, incomplete EDL formation leads to an alternating electric field that propagates far into the bulk solution, inducing rapid ion migration that overwhelms the Brownian motion of ions. Electrochemical characterization reveals EDL charging/discharging under AC conditions that greatly inhibits precipitation. Operating at 4 V pp , 0.1–10 Hz reduces turbidity by over 96% and reduces CaCO 3 coverage on the metal plates by over 92%. Based on electrokinetic and crystallization models, the ion displacement velocity (exceeding the mean Brownian velocity) and displacement length disrupts ion collision and crystal nucleation. Overall, the technique has potential for preventing mineral crystal formation in heat exchangers and many other industrially relevant systems.","Focus on preventing mineral scaling in industrial and water-related infrastructure like pipes, membranes, and heat exchangers.",Nature Communications,2025,16,1,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55176-z,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,9,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. “Past” and “future” simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model which represents plausible “pseudo-realities” under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the “pseudo-reality” imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (&gt;500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial attribution results, unlike the &gt;20-member ensemble from the dynamical model.

Forecasting this snowmelt is vital for water supply planning and is a key task of the California Department of Water Resources’ Bulletin-120. Accurate predictions rely on subseasonal 2-m temperature (T2m) forecasts, especially at high elevations where snowpack and runoff contributions are greatest. Current systems like the California Nevada River Forecast Center’s (CNRFC) Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) have identified T2m forecasts as a key uncertainty source. However, research on fine-resolution subseasonal temperature forecasting in complex terrain is limited. This study uses the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset as ground truth and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) reforecasts to apply Analog Ensemble (AnEn) post-processing, producing high-resolution (4-km) daily T2m forecasts for the Sierra Nevada. We find that during the spring snowmelt season (AprilJuly), AnEn reduces T2m forecast rootmean-squared error by 1°C (60% for 1-day leads, 20% for 15-day leads), increases correlation by ~11%, extends skill by an additional week beyond dynamical benchmarks, and illustrates added value beyond a basic bias correction method (the Ensemble Model Output Statistics). Improvements are more pronounced at higher elevations (e.g., 3000–3500 m), with root-mean-squared error reduced by 4°C, correlation rising from 0.1 to 0.9, and skill extended by two weeks. By enhancing T2m accuracy for Bulletin-120 and CNRFC-HEFS systems, AnEn can boost the precision of snowmelt and streamflow predictions, supporting improved water resource management in a changing climate.","Focuses on improving temperature forecasts for better prediction of snowmelt, water storage, and streamflow.",Journal of Hydrometeorology,2025,26,,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-25-0012.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Jacob Kollen,9,DFO

Feedbacks arising from atmospheric and oceanic transport processes, surface fluxes, and radiation drive the cyclical amplification and decay of convection around suppressed and enhanced convective equilibrium states, referred to as shallow and deep convective discharge–recharge (D–R) cycles, respectively. The shallow convective D–R cycle is characterized by alternating enhancements of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus, often in the presence of extensive cirrus clouds. The deep convective D–R cycle is characterized by sequential increases in shallow cumulus, congestus, narrow deep precipitation, wide deep precipitation, a mix of detached anvil and altostratus and altocumulus, and once again shallow cumulus cloud types. Transitions from the shallow to deep D–R cycle are favored by a positive “column process” feedback, while discharge of convective instability and OHC by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) contributes to transitions from the deep to shallow D–R cycle. Variability in the processes impacting MSE is comparable in magnitude to, but considerably more balanced than, variability in the processes impacting OHC. Variations in the quantity of atmosphere–ocean coupled static energy (MSE + OHC) result primarily from atmospheric and oceanic transport processes, but are mainly realized as changes in OHC.

We tested the primer set on positive controls and on fecal pellets collected from bait stations at two regularly monitored field sites known to have very different densities of salt marsh harvest mice. The multiplex amplified DNA from all five species, even when all five species were present in a single sample. A positive species identification was made for all field-collected samples, and 43% of these field-collected samples had multispecies detections.

A significant challenge for utilizing satellite radiances is the accurate estimation of their biases. High-accuracy nonradiance data are commonly employed to anchor radiance bias corrections. However, aside from the impacts of radio occultation data in the stratosphere, the influence of other types of “anchor” observation data on radiance assimilation remains unclear. This study provides an assessment of impacts of dropsonde data collected during the Atmospheric River (AR) Reconnaissance program, which samples ARs over the northeast Pacific, on the radiance assimilation using the Global Forecast System (GFS) and Global Data Assimilation System at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The assimilation of this dropsonde dataset has proven crucial for providing enhanced anchoring for bias corrections and improving the model background, leading to an increase of ∼5%–10% in the number of assimilated microwave radiance in the lower troposphere/midtroposphere over the northeast Pacific and North America. The impact on tropospheric infrared radiance is not only small but also beneficial. Impacts of dropsondes on the use of stratospheric channels are minimal due to the absence of dropsonde observations at certain altitudes, such as aircraft flight levels (e.g., 150 hPa). Results in this study underscore the usefulness of dropsondes, along with other conventional data, in optimizing the assimilation of satellite radiance. This study reinforces the importance of a diverse observing network for accurate weather forecasting and highlights the specific benefits derived from integrating dropsonde data into radiance assimilation processes. Significance Statement This study aims to evaluate the impact of aircraft reconnaissance dropsondes on the assimilation of satellite radiance data, utilizing observations from the 2020 Atmospheric River Reconnaissance program. The key findings reveal a substantial enhancement in the model first guess and improved estimates of radiance biases. Notably, there is a significant 5%–10% increase in microwave radiance observations over the northeastern Pacific and North America, with positive yet modest effects observed in tropospheric infrared radiance. These findings underscore the crucial role of atmospheric river reconnaissance dropsondes as anchor data, enhancing the assimilation of radiance observations.

Utilizing a customized high-resolution AR prediction system and 34 water-year reforecast (West-WRF), we identify flow patterns associated with specific error patterns and predictive skill. This process helps document model error sources and ultimately address forecast deficiencies. Using self-organizing maps (SOMs), we sort thousands of AR reforecasts at 72 and 144-hour lead times, grouping them based on different training variables to create 2D matrices of synoptic-scale patterns. Initial efforts to train SOMs using West-WRF integrated vapor transport (IVT) failed to show strong skill differences between pattern groupings. However, SOMs trained on IVT differences between reforecasts (West-WRF) and reanalyses (ERA5) elucidate different meteorological patterns of forecast errors. Primary IVT error patterns are related to AR translation speed or intensity errors. Flow patterns associated with the characteristic errors are consistent with the skill determined using object-orientied verification metrics. Groupings subset by ENSO and MJO illustrate elevated error frequency with some phases. At a 6-day lead time, El Niño conditions preferentially accompany forecasts of negative AR intensity bias, while La Niña conditions favor forecasts with positive translation speed and intensity biases. A positive translation speed bias also tended to favor MJO phase 5, while the opposite tendency was observed for negative translation speed biases. Meteorological fields associated with these AR translation speed and intensity biases are also analyzed, allowing the selection of representative cases for detailed analysis.","Analyzes atmospheric river reforecast errors and predictive skill, linking to atmospheric processes and climate dynamics.",Weather and Forecasting,2025,40,,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/waf-d-24-0160.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

On 31 December 2019, all of the agricultural drainage from a 44,000 ha subarea on the western side of the San Joaquin River basin was curtailed. This policy requires the on-site disposal of all of the agricultural drainage water in perpetuity, except during flooding events, when emergency drainage to the River is sanctioned. The reuse of this saline agricultural drainage water to irrigate forage crops, such as ‘Jose’ tall wheatgrass and alfalfa, in a 2428 ha reuse facility provides an economic return on this pollutant disposal option. Irrigation with brackish water requires careful management to prevent salt accumulation in the crop root zone, which can impact forage yields. The objective of this study was to optimize the sustainability of this reuse facility by maximizing the evaporation potential while achieving cost recovery. This was achieved by assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of the root zone salinity in selected fields of ‘Jose’ tall wheatgrass and alfalfa in the drainage reuse facility, some of which have been irrigated with brackish subsurface drainage water for over fifteen years. Electromagnetic soil surveys using an EM-38 instrument were used to measure the spatial variability of the salinity in the soil profile. The tall wheatgrass fields were irrigated with higher salinity water (1.2–9.3 dS m−1) compared to the fields of alfalfa (0.5–6.5 dS m−1). Correspondingly, the soil salinity in the tall wheatgrass fields was higher (12.5 dS m−1–19.3 dS m−1) compared to the alfalfa fields (8.97 dS m−1–14.4 dS m−1) for the years 2016 and 2017. Better leaching of salts was observed in the fields with a subsurface drainage system installed (13–1 and 13–2). The depth-averaged root zone salinity data sets are being used for the calibration of the transient hydro-salinity computer model CSUID-ID (a one-dimensional version of the Colorado State University Irrigation Drainage Model). This user-friendly decision support tool currently provides a useful framework for the data collection needed to make credible, field-scale salinity budgets. In time, it will provide guidance for appropriate leaching requirements and potential blending decisions for sustainable forage production. This paper shows the tie between environmental drainage policy and the role of local governance in the development of sustainable irrigation practices, and how well-directed collaborative field research can guide future resource management.","Focuses on policy, governance, economic factors, and water management in a socio-environmental context.",Sustainability,2020,12,16,MDPI AG,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12166362,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/16/6362/pdf?version=1596792189,TRUE,TRUE,gold,,10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

The present study investigates the LLJ using dropsonde observations from 24 cross-atmospheric river transects taken during the CalWater-2014, 2015 and the AR-Recon 2016, 2018 field campaigns. It is found that the LLJ, located at ~1-km elevation ahead of the cold front, has an average maximum wind speed of 30 m s−1 and is strongly supergeostrophic with an average ageostrophic component of 6 m s−1. The alongfront ageostrophy occurs within the atmospheric layer (750–1250 m) known to strongly control orographic precipitation associated with atmospheric rivers. The ERA5 reanalysis product is used to both validate the observed geostrophic winds and investigate the supergeostrophic jet dynamics. The comparison demonstrates that there is no systematic bias in the observed geostrophic wind but that the ERA5 LLJ total wind field is generally biased low by an amount consistent with the observed ageostrophy. One of the few cases in which the ERA5 produces an ageostrophic LLJ occurs on 13 February 2016, which is used to investigate the dynamical processes responsible for the ageostrophy. This analysis demonstrates that the isallobaric (pressure tendency) term serves to accelerate the ageostrophic jet, and the Coriolis torque and advective tendency terms serve to propagate the jet normal to the LLJ. Therefore, if a model is to accurately represent the LLJ, it must adequately resolve processes contributing toward the pressure tendencies along the cold front.",Study of atmospheric rivers and low-level jet dynamics and their contribution to weather patterns.,Monthly Weather Review,2020,148,4,American Meteorological Society,https://doi.org/10.1175/mwr-d-19-0248.1,,FALSE,FALSE,closed,,21,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Inference difficulties for simple linear SSMs are well known, particularly in relation to simultaneous estimation of process and observation variances. Several remedies to overcome estimation problems have been studied for relatively simple SSMs, but whether these challenges and proposed remedies apply for nonlinear stage-structured SSMs, an important class of ecological models, is less well understood. Here we identify improvements for inference about nonlinear stage-structured SSMs fit with biased sequential life stage data. Theoretical analyses indicate parameter identifiability requires covariates in the state processes. Simulation studies show that plugging in externally estimated observation variances, as opposed to jointly estimating them with other parameters, reduces bias and standard error of estimates. In contrast to previous results for simple linear SSMs, strong confounding between jointly estimated process and observation variance parameters was not found in the models explored here. However, when observation variance was also estimated in the motivating case study, the resulting process variance estimates were implausibly low (near-zero). As SSMs are used in increasingly complex ways, understanding when inference can be expected to be successful, and what aids it, becomes more important.

Four other machine learning (ML) models, previously developed and reported, consisting of multi-layer perceptron (MLP), residual network (ResNet), LSTM, and GRU are utilized as the baseline models to benchmark the performance of the two novel models.

Meanwhile, field observations of salinity at the study locations during the same period are also utilized for the development of the predictive use of the models. Results indicate that the proposed DL models generally outperform the baseline models in simulating and predicting salinity on both daily and hourly scales at the study locations.

The foremost step in such management practices is understanding the spatial and temporal variations of salinity and the principal drivers of these variations. This has traditionally been achieved with the assistance of empirical or process-based models, but these can be computationally expensive for complex environmental systems. Model emulation based on data-driven methods offers a viable alternative to traditional modeling in terms of computational efficiency and improving accuracy by recognizing patterns and processes that are overlooked or underrepresented (or overrepresented) by traditional models.

These neural network models are trained and validated using half of the dataset from water year 1991 to 2002. They are then evaluated for performance in the remaining record period from water year 2003 to 2014 against the process-based boundary salinity generation model across different ranges of salinity in different types of water years. The results indicate that deep learning neural networks provide competitive or superior results compared with the process-based model, particularly when the output of the latter are incorporated as an input to the former. The improvements are generally more noticeable during extreme (i.e., wet, dry, and critical) years rather than in near-normal (i.e., above-normal and below-normal) years and during low and medium ranges of salinity rather than high range salinity.

Outside the Delta, there is a significant history of research on IAV control in lotic systems, but few studies come from tidal environments, and we found no investigations at a spatial scale like that of the Delta. The science of control efforts in the Delta is nascent but has seen marked growth over the recent decade. Since 1983, control of invasive submerged and floating species has been centralized within the California State Parks Division of Boating and Waterways (CDBW). The program relies on herbicides, with an annual budget that has exceeded $12.5 million since 2015. However, the results have been mixed because of the challenge of applying herbicides effectively in a tidal system. In parallel, biological control agents for water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and giant reed (Arundo donax) have been released but have not provided an appreciable control benefit, likely because they are not suited for the temperate Delta climate. Over recent decades, regulatory complexity has increased, hampering efforts to innovate alternative methods or respond quickly to new invaders. Control efforts for giant reed and common reed (Phragmites australis), the main invasive emergent plants, have not been coordinated under a central program, and studies to investigate control strategies have only recently been permitted.

The estuary’s salinity regime—broadly regulated to meet urban, agricultural, and ecosystem beneficial uses—is managed in spring and certain fall months to meet ecosystem objectives by controlling the 2 parts per thousand bottom salinity isohaline position (referred to as X2). We tested five empirical models for accuracy, mean, and transient behavior. We included a sixth model, employing a machine learning framework and variables other than outflow, in this survey to compare fitting skill, but did not subject it to the full suite of tests applied to the other five empirical models. Model performance was observed to vary with hydrology, year, and season, and in some cases exhibited unique limitations as a result of mathematical formulation. However, no single model formulation was found to be consistently superior across a wide range of tests and applications. One test revealed that the models performed equally well when recalibrated to a uniformly perturbed input time-series. Thus, while the models may be used to identify anomalies or seasonal biases (the latter being the subject of a companion paper), their use as inverse models to infer freshwater outflow to the estuary from salinity observations is not expected to improve upon the absolute accuracy of existing outflow estimates.

Both export projects have fish salvage facilities that use behavioral barriers (louvers) in combination with screens to guide fish into collection areas from which they are trucked to release points in the western Delta. Sacramento River-origin Chinook Salmon are regularly taken in the projects’ fish salvage operations. Survival has been estimated within the boundaries of both intake structures, but not in Old River. Prevailing methods for estimating fish losses are based on studies of louver efficiency, near-field survival at the state facility, and assumed survival at the federal facility. The efficiency of the fish salvage operations is affected by several factors, including intake velocity, debris build-up on the louvers and trash racks, and by the omnipresence of predators in front of and within the fish guidance structures. Analysis of existing data suggests that under average conditions, juvenile salmon survive entrainment into the forebay of the state facility at a rate of less than 10%. There is no evidence for better survival at the federal facility. We found no data on predation outside of either the state’s forebay or the federal trash boom, structures which are separated by an approximately 2-km reach of Old River where predation on small fish is thought to be intense. We suggest an improvement to the existing loss estimation, and discuss some features of the studies needed to increase its accuracy and precision.",Focuses on estimating salmon mortality caused by water export facilities to support fisheries management.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2020,18,3,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2020v18iss3art3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt5gr7h7nm/qt5gr7h7nm.pdf?t=qhi1zn,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,6,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

A prominent feature is the wind-generated waves, which transfer energy and lead to various phenomena not observed where the hydrodynamics is dictated only by currents. Over the past several decades, numerical models have been developed to predict the wave and current state and their interactions. Most models, however, have relied on the two-model approach in which the wave model is developed independently of the current model and the two are coupled together through a separate steering module. In this study, a new wave model is developed and embedded in an existing two-dimensional (2D) depth-integrated current model, SRH-2D. The work leads to a new wave–current model based on the one-model approach. The physical processes of the new wave model are based on the latest third-generation formulation in which the spectral wave action balance equation is solved so that the spectrum shape is not pre-imposed and the non-linear effects are not parameterized. New contributions of the present study lie primarily in the numerical method adopted, which include: (a) a new operator-splitting method that allows an implicit solution of the wave action equation in the geographical space; (b) mixed finite volume and finite difference method; (c) unstructured polygonal mesh in the geographical space; and (d) a single mesh for both the wave and current models that paves the way for the use of the one-model approach. An advantage of the present model is that the propagation of waves from deep water to shallow water in near-shore and the interaction between waves and river inflows may be carried out seamlessly. Tedious interpolations and the so-called multi-model steering operation adopted by many existing models are avoided. As a result, the underlying interpolation errors and information loss due to matching between two meshes are avoided, leading to an increased computational efficiency and accuracy. The new wave model is developed and verified using a number of cases. The verified near-shore wave processes include wave shoaling, refraction, wave breaking and diffraction.

This study investigates and contrasts four machine learning (ML) models (Regression Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neuronal Networks) for approximating ion constituent concentrations based on EC measurements, emphasizing the enhancement of conversion for constituents exhibiting pronounced non-linear relationships with EC.

All four ML models surpass traditional parametric regression equations in terms of accuracy in estimating ion concentrations.

One potential solution is to realign funding priorities to promote efforts across different scales, from genetic to species to ecosystem. With limited funding, prioritization approaches seek to maximize impact by returning to ongoing conservation efforts or focusing on high-profile species. However, these approaches reinforce biases against more equitable allocation because a lack of knowledge about understudied groups can be seen as detrimental to conservation success and prohibitively expensive. This study shows that these biases in conservation research are long standing and still ongoing, which will ultimately lead to an uneven loss of biodiversity. Deliberate funding and targeted efforts are needed to investigate both understudied species and ecosystems.Highlights•Biases in conservation research have not changed over time•Conservation research increasingly focuses on the same suite of species•Conservation status of a species does not seem to predict research attention•Targeted funding of understudied systems is necessary to even out research imbalanceSummaryEfforts to conserve biodiversity have been hampered by long-standing biases, including a disproportionate focus on particular taxa and ecosystems with minimal attention to underlying genetic diversity. We assessed whether these biases have persisted over the past four decades by analyzing trends in 17,502 research articles published in four top conservation-focused journals. Overall, we found that historical biases in conservation biology research remain entrenched. Despite increasing numbers of conservation articles published each decade from 1980 to 2020, research effort has increasingly focused on the same suite of taxa. Surprisingly, some of the most-studied species in these conservation articles had low conservation risk, including several domesticated animals. Animals and terrestrial ecosystems are consistently over-represented while plants, fungi, and freshwater ecosystems remain under-represented. Strategically funding investigations of understudied species and ecosystems will ensure more effective conservation effort across multiple levels of biodiversity, alleviate impediments to biodiversity targets, and ultimately prevent further extinctions.Graphical abstract",Analyzes conservation research biases to inform funding and policy for biodiversity protection.,Cell Reports Sustainability,2024,1,5,Elsevier BV,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2024.100082,,TRUE,TRUE,gold,cc-by,31,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Sean J Canfield,9,DISE

Field studies have shown the fundamental influence of the bedrock surface geometry on subsurface stormflow (SSSF) and that the SSSF process consists of at least two major components: the matrix flow component and the macropore flow component that are in dynamical interaction toward forming the SSSF. Furthermore, field studies have shown that the bedrock surface that underlies the SSSF has essentially a two‐dimensional (2D) geometry, where not only the longitudinal profile along the hillslope but also the profile in the transverse direction influence the subsurface stormflow over the bedrock. The macropore flow itself being a multidimensional flow process, requires a multidimensional matrix flow component in order to quantify realistic dynamical interactions between these components within the subsurface stormflow module of a watershed hydrology model. Within this framework, the critical research question is how to extend the existing 2D Boussinesq model for the matrix flow over an inclined flat 2D surface in the longitudinal hillslope direction by developing the governing equations of matrix flow at hillslope scale over various 2D bedrock surface geometries that are reported in the field studies of SSSF. Then, numerical experiments are performed by applying the developed governing equations to various bedrock surface geometries. The results of the numerical simulations show (a) the proposed governing equations can simulate various two‐dimensional bedrock surface geometries, and are capable of incorporating the upward or downward concavity of bedrock surface in longitudinal and transverse directions into SSSF by modulating the timing and magnitude of the flows and (b) the proposed governing equations for matrix flow provide an appropriate setting for the dynamical interaction of the matrix flows with the macropore flows, creating a promising modeling framework for SSSF.","Article develops governing equations for subsurface stormflow, a key component of the hydrological cycle, and its modeling.",Water Resources Research,2022,58,12,American Geophysical Union (AGU),https://doi.org/10.1029/2022wr033433,,FALSE,TRUE,green,,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Analysis of 60 precipitation events in water years 2014–2017 showed that the approach provides estimates of precipitation and orographic enhancement that reduce uncertainty from apparent snow undercatch by limited gauges. This approach also infers total precipitation based on snow measurements during rain‐on‐snow events. The sensor network and blending approach yielded median upper‐basin orographic precipitation gradients (OPGs) of 0.57 km −1 , smaller than the also‐positive lower‐basin (&lt;1,500 m) medians OPGs from precipitation gauges and a gauge‐based gridded data set of 1.23 and 1.00 km −1 , respectively. However, during 73% of the events, both gauges and the gridded product showed negative OPGs in the upper basin, inconsistent with typically positive values from the distributed sensor network. Upper‐basin OPGs from gauges and the gridded product were more negative ( p ‐values &lt; 0.03) during heavy events related to atmospheric rivers and Sierra barrier jets than during milder events, revealing the challenges for gauges to reliably measure precipitation from large moisture transport by strong winds.

Here, we analyzed juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) bycatch data that has been collected by the recently established Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring program (EDSM), a survey designed to estimate the abundance and distribution of the San Francisco Estuary’s (estuary) endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Two key aspects of the EDSM program distinguish it from other fish surveys in the estuary: a stratified random sampling design and the spatial scale of its sampling effort. We integrated the EDSM data set with other existing surveys in the estuary, and used an occupancy model to assess differences in the probability of detecting Delta Smelt across gear types. We saw no large-scale differences in size selectivity, and while detection probability varied among gear types, cumulative detection probability for EDSM was comparable to other surveys because of the program’s use of replicate tows. Based on our occupancy model and sampling effort in the estuary during spring of 2017 and 2018, we highlighted under-sampled regions that saw improvements in monitoring coverage from EDSM. Our analysis also revealed that each sampling method has its own benefits and constraints. Although the use of random sites with replicates, as conducted by EDSM, can provide more statistically robust abundance estimates relative to traditional methods, the use of fixed stations and simple methods such as beach seining may provide a more cost-effective way to monitor salmon occurrence in certain regions of the estuary. Leveraging the strengths of each survey’s method can enable stronger inferences on salmon abundance and distribution. Careful consideration of these trade-offs is crucial as the management agencies of the estuary continue to adapt and improve their monitoring programs.",Article details fish population monitoring for conservation and management in an estuary.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447//sfews.2020v19iss1art2,https://escholarship.org/content/qt9sp7r7q4/qt9sp7r7q4.pdf?t=qq507a,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Pascale Goertler,6,

The distribution of Delta Smelt in the estuary shifts landward from low-salinity habitat to freshwater habitat before spawning. This spawning migration often coincides with the first substantial freshwater inflow to the estuary during winter. To accomplish this landward shift in distribution, Delta Smelt are believed to use the tides by swimming to faster-moving currents during flood tides and then repositioning themselves to slower-moving currents to reduce seaward movement on ebb tides. Studies have hypothesized that the swimming behavior of Delta Smelt during this period is influenced by environmental conditions such as salinity and turbidity. The details of these swimming behaviors—including the extent to which flows, salinity, and turbidity affect behaviors and distributions—are uncertain. The spawning migration is of management interest because an increase in observed counts of Delta Smelt at the South Delta water-export facilities has coincided roughly with the spawning migration in many years. In this study, we investigated a range of hypothesized swimming behaviors using a three-dimensional particle-tracking model for water year 2002 during the spawning migration, and compared the predicted distributions of Delta Smelt to distributions inferred from catch data. Our goal was to improve understanding of the influence of Delta Smelt swimming on distribution, and, ultimately, to develop a modeling tool to help management agencies identify conditions associated with entrainment losses. Predictions of Delta Smelt distributions and entrainment varied greatly among behaviors. Without swimming, Delta Smelt would be rapidly transported seaward of Suisun Bay, while continuous tidal migration would move them deep into the interior Delta. These behaviors and a simple turbidity-driven behavior model predicted distributions inconsistent with observations, while more complex behavior rules allowed improved predictions.",Modeling fish behavior and distribution to support conservation management of an endangered species.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2021,19,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447//sfews.2020v19iss1art3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0dh783r5/qt0dh783r5.pdf?t=qq507a,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,3,EXEC

The unintended transmission of pathogens can have devastating effects on these already at-risk populations or the natural ecosystem at large. In the San Francisco Estuary (estuary), abundance of the endemic Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) has declined to the point where regulatory managers are preparing to augment the wild population using fish propagated in a hatchery to prevent species extinction. Although disease is not an overt cause of population decline, comprehensive pathogen presence and prevalence data are lacking. Here, we performed a pilot study that applied molecular assays originally developed in salmonids to assess the presence of a wide variety of pathogens in the gill tissue of cultured and wild Delta Smelt—as well as cultured fish—deployed in enclosures in the estuary. We found the assays to be highly sensitive, and observed positive detections of a single pathogen, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, in 13% of cultured Delta Smelt. We also detected ten other pathogens at very low levels in cultured, enclosure-deployed, and wild Delta Smelt that likely represent the ambient pathogen composition in the estuary (as opposed to actual infection). Our results corroborate previous work that cultured Delta Smelt do not appear to present a high risk for pathogen transmission during population supplementation or reintroduction. However, the molecular pathogen screening assays tested here have great utility as an early warning system indicator of when further diagnostic testing might be necessary to limit the extent and frequency of disease outbreaks; their utility will be further increased once they are customized for Delta Smelt.",Focuses on pathogen screening in Delta Smelt for conservation and population management.,San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science,2022,20,1,California Digital Library (CDL),https://doi.org/10.15447/sfews.2022v20iss20art4,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6gj0c4zs/qt6gj0c4zs.pdf?t=r8xxil,TRUE,TRUE,diamond,cc-by,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Daphne Gille,1,DISE

However, food‐web structure may provide valuable insight into ecosystem functioning trajectories. Here, we studied restored tidal marshes of different ages ( new , young , old ; spanning 1–150 years) in comparison with nearby reference sites along the San Francisco Estuary. We asked: (1) How does restoration help recover energy pathways that support fishes? (2) Do fishes rely more on algal versus detrital pathways in restored sites?; and (3) How does food‐web structure vary as a function of species origin and life history? To answer these questions, we sampled fish ( n = 806) and basal resources (emergent vegetation and phytoplankton; n = 109) seasonally over two hydrologically contrasting years. Using stable isotopes (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and δ 34 S), we calculated fish isotopic niche volumes, food chain lengths, and the relative importance of algal versus detrital energy pathways. We found that food chains in restored sites were 8% shorter than in their paired reference sites. Additionally, the young and old restored sites had 37% smaller niche volumes than their references, but the opposite was true for the new restored site (11% larger), illustrating the characteristic trophic surge of early succession. Fishes found in restored sites relied significantly less on detrital energy (7% less) than fishes found in reference sites, and resident fishes showed 12% higher reliance on the detrital pathway than transient species. Finally, most of the native niche volume overlapped with that of introduced fish, which was in turn 38% larger, and a similar pattern was observed when comparing resident to transient fish. Our findings demonstrate that food‐web structure does not immediately recover with tidal marsh restoration, even if fish assemblages are species‐rich; and show that transient trophic surges may complicate restoration success assessments of newly restored marshes. We contend that incorporating recovery of energy pathways as an indicator of performance may help strengthen monitoring and design of wetland ecosystem restoration projects.",Evaluates tidal marsh restoration success by studying trophic pathways and fish populations.,Ecological Applications,2025,35,7,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.70110,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/eap.70110,TRUE,TRUE,hybrid,cc-by-nc-nd,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Lenny Grimaldo,6,EXEC

Complete water retention and conductivity curves for top (0–5 cm) and subsurface (20–25 cm) samples were characterized and contrasted. Plot-level properties of water storage and retention were evaluated using numerical simulations in HYDRUS-2D software. Soils under no-till (NT) and cover cropping (CC) systems showed an improved soil structure in terms of pore size distribution (PSD) and the hydraulic conductivity (K) under these systems led to increased infiltration rate and water retention. The conventional measurement of water content at field capacity (water content at −33 kPa suction) and the associated plant available water (PAW) showed that NT and CC plots had lower water content at field capacity and lower PAW compared to standard-till (ST) and plots without cover crop (NO). The numerical simulations, however, showed that NT and CC plots have higher profile-level water storage (albeit marginal in magnitude) and water availability following irrigation. Because the numerical simulations consider retention and conductivity functions simultaneously and dynamically through time, they allow the capture of hydraulic properties that are arguably more relevant to crops. The changes in PSD, water conductivity, and water storage associated with NT and CC systems observed in this study suggest that these systems are beneficial to general soil health and improve water retention at the plot scale.","Examines the impact of cover crops and tillage on soil structure, pore size, and water retention properties.",,2021,,,Copernicus GmbH,https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-2021-41,,TRUE,TRUE,green,cc-by,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,

Battles; Benjamin W. Tobin; M.H. Conklin,University of California Merced,,geological and earth sciences,hydrology,0.95,"We applied an eco‐hydrologic model (Regional Hydro‐Ecologic Simulation System [RHESSys]), constrained with spatially distributed field measurements, to assess the impacts of forest‐fuel treatments and wildfire on hydrologic fluxes in two Sierra Nevada firesheds. Strategically placed fuels treatments were implemented during 2011–2012 in the upper American River in the central Sierra Nevada (43 km2) and in the upper Fresno River in the southern Sierra Nevada (24 km2). This study used the measured vegetation changes from mechanical treatments and modelled vegetation change from wildfire to determine impacts on the water balance. The well‐constrained headwater model was transferred to larger catchments based on geologic and hydrologic similarities. Fuels treatments covered 18% of the American and 29% of the Lewis catchment. Averaged over the entire catchment, treatments in the wetter central Sierra Nevada resulted in a relatively light vegetation decrease (8%), leading to a 12% runoff increase, averaged over wet and dry years. Wildfire with and without forest treatments reduced vegetation by 38% and 50% and increased runoff by 55% and 67%, respectively. Treatments in the drier southern Sierra Nevada also reduced the spatially averaged vegetation by 8%, but the runoff response was limited to an increase of less than 3% compared with no treatment. Wildfire following treatments reduced vegetation by 40%, increasing runoff by 13%. Changes to catchment‐scale water‐balance simulations were more sensitive to canopy cover than to leaf area index, indicating that the pattern as well as amount of vegetation treatment is important to hydrologic response.","Analyzes the impacts of forest-fuel treatments and wildfire on hydrologic fluxes and water balance, particularly runoff.",Ecohydrology,2020,13,,Wiley,https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.2151,,,,,,22,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,
